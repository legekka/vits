dataset/train/0_1.wav|Today on my desk we have a brand new top of the line Galaxy S23 Ultra – Samsung's
dataset/train/0_2.wav|current best offering to the masses. No time to waste. Let's get started.
dataset/train/0_3.wav|This latest and greatest smartphone is tucked inside a 100% recycled paper box. Super cool
dataset/train/0_4.wav|of Samsung to cut out the plastic packaging. Samsung is very quick to point out all their
dataset/train/0_5.wav|new environmentally friendly initiatives on their website, like using natural dyes in their Earth
dataset/train/0_6.wav|Tone smartphone lineup. The one in front of us is an eco green color – not too shabby. Natural
dataset/train/0_7.wav|color dyes that are completely down to earth sound epically awesome at first glance. I'm
dataset/train/0_8.wav|as big of a tree hugger as the next guy, but when we scroll down a bit on the website and
dataset/train/0_9.wav|see the fine print, only 10% of this down to earth dye is natural. I'm no rocket surgeon,
dataset/train/0_10.wav|but according to my math that leaves about 90% of the dye being unnatural, which is a rather
dataset/train/0_11.wav|weird thing to brag about. The word for this kind of thing is called “green washing,” and Samsung
dataset/train/0_12.wav|does it again right here on their website saying that their phone has recycled glass on the screen,
dataset/train/0_13.wav|and recycled rear glass panels without any asterisks or caveats. We do know that
dataset/train/0_14.wav|glass can be 100% recyclable, so Samsung using totally recycled glass isn't out of the question.
dataset/train/0_15.wav|But if we look into the Corning Gorilla Glass recipe, Vicis 2 is only using 22% pre consumer
dataset/train/0_16.wav|recycled content...not even postconsumer. And of course, we still see scratches at a level 6,
dataset/train/0_17.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7. And definitely don't get me wrong, any amount of recycling is
dataset/train/0_18.wav|good recycling. But as the literal largest manufacturer of smartphones on the planet,
dataset/train/0_19.wav|Samsung shouldn't be patting themselves on the back for doing the bare minimum for the planet.
dataset/train/0_20.wav|Up here at the top of the screen, protected under the glass, we find the 12 megapixel
dataset/train/0_21.wav|hole punch selfie camera. And just for kicks and giggles we'll snap a quick little selfie
dataset/train/0_22.wav|and compare it to a selfie from my personal 3 ½ year old Note 10 Plus. Feel free to take a look,
dataset/train/0_23.wav|admire for a second and be honest with yourself, you're not even sure which picture came from which
dataset/train/0_24.wav|phone. Samsung has had 3 ½ years to give me a reason to upgrade and I ain't seeing it yet.
dataset/train/0_25.wav|The sides of the phone are covered with a thin layer of plastic again. Not my favorite, but
dataset/train/0_26.wav|cardboard can be abrasive to a pristine finish. I can see why Samsung would want to be careful.
dataset/train/0_27.wav|The sides of the S23 Ultra are made from Armor Aluminum. You
dataset/train/0_28.wav|can see by the way the 90% unnatural dye scrapes off leaving bare metal behind.
dataset/train/0_29.wav|The side buttons are made from metal and can still be removed. The top of the phone has a
dataset/train/0_30.wav|microphone hole and an antenna line. Not much happening on the metal left side of the phone.
dataset/train/0_31.wav|The bottom however, is where everything is happening. We have our loudspeaker grill,
dataset/train/0_32.wav|the USB-C charging port that can charge at 45 watts, and a SIM card tray right next to
dataset/train/0_33.wav|the microphone hole. The SIM card tray does have a gray rubber ring to help with the S23 Ultra's ip68
dataset/train/0_34.wav|water resistance. And, of course, our good friend the s-pen. Probably my favorite part of the Ultra
dataset/train/0_35.wav|lineup. The s-pen is useful for a lot of things. The tip can be detected by the screen using the
dataset/train/0_36.wav|coil of copper wires in the tip. The s-pen can also act as a remote control for the camera
dataset/train/0_37.wav|using the button, a bluetooth chip, and internal capacitor at the back end that can wirelessly
dataset/train/0_38.wav|charge up in seconds. We'll check out the internal wireless s-pen charging during the teardown video.
dataset/train/0_39.wav|The phone itself has its own separate wireless charging capabilities underneath the back glass
dataset/train/0_40.wav|panel, 15 watts of wireless charging under the glass, with 4.5 watts of reverse wireless
dataset/train/0_41.wav|charging. The whole thing is covered with glass, just like we've seen for the past 8 years. The
dataset/train/0_42.wav|only real difference between this S23 Ultra and last year's S22 Ultra is the camera setup. Well,
dataset/train/0_43.wav|actually, just one of the cameras. We have the normal 12 megapixel ultra wide camera up top,
dataset/train/0_44.wav|but this guy here in the middle is a whopping 200 megapixels, and legitimately does some cool stuff,
dataset/train/0_45.wav|like take pictures of the moon. And has twice the normal optical image stabilization, which will
dataset/train/0_46.wav|be awesome to take a look at during the teardown. We have a 10 megapixel 10x telephoto zoom camera,
dataset/train/0_47.wav|and another 10 megapixel 3x zoom over on the side. And I'm not going to lie,
dataset/train/0_48.wav|that 200 megapixel camera is pretty cool, but not $1,200 cool.
dataset/train/0_49.wav|Flipping around to the screen side of things, we once again have a 6.8 inch, 1440p Dynamic AMOLED,
dataset/train/0_50.wav|with a variable refresh rate to help prolong battery life. If that sounds familiar,
dataset/train/0_51.wav|it's because it's the same exact screen Samsung used last year. You might be asking,
dataset/train/0_52.wav|'Hey Jerry, what happened to all the smartphone innovations we used to see from Samsung. And well,
dataset/train/0_53.wav|you might have noticed that Samsung is spending a lot of money making it seem
dataset/train/0_54.wav|like everyone is buying new tech every single year – billions of dollars in fact. But the truth is,
dataset/train/0_55.wav|even with all those billions spent, a refreshing ninety percent of people do
dataset/train/0_56.wav|not upgrade every year. Even polling among super nerds, more than 60% of you wait more than three
dataset/train/0_57.wav|years to upgrade your phone which I think is awesome. As my mom would say, use it up,
dataset/train/0_58.wav|wear it out, make it do, or do without. Even though Samsung is using billions to make you
dataset/train/0_59.wav|think upgrading yearly is normal or that buying a phone with 10% natural dye is environmentally
dataset/train/0_60.wav|friendly. If Samsung really wanted people to upgrade, my suggestion would be to take some
dataset/train/0_61.wav|of those tens of billions of dollars worth of marketing and plop it back into the innovating
dataset/train/0_62.wav|budget and let the phones sell themselves with features...kind of like Tesla does with cars.
dataset/train/0_63.wav|Got a little carried away there. The screen actually handled the heat pretty well – all
dataset/train/0_64.wav|60 seconds of it. I hope Samsung handles the heat. And just to add a little insult
dataset/train/0_65.wav|to injury let me know down in the comments if you got a Samsung advertisement on this video.
dataset/train/0_66.wav|As far as durability goes, Samsung has never had any issues besides the model that exploded,
dataset/train/0_67.wav|everything else has been pretty great, and this S23 Ultra is no exception.
dataset/train/0_68.wav|Bending from the front we get no flex. And flipping over the Ultra to the back...rigid
dataset/train/0_69.wav|as a rock. For anyone who does buy this model, whether it's this year for full price or next
dataset/train/0_70.wav|year for half price, the S23 Ultra is indeed still structurally sound, even though the
dataset/train/0_71.wav|marketing team is pulling far more weight than the innovation team. If you're the type of person
dataset/train/0_72.wav|who doesn't want to be manipulated by billions of dollars worth of advertising and only wants
dataset/train/0_73.wav|to be manipulated by regular dollars worth of advertising, I'd love to introduce you to dbrand.
dataset/train/0_74.wav|The only reason my phone has lasted 3 ½ years is because I have a case on it – the Grip case from
dataset/train/0_75.wav|dbrand to be specific. And you might have surmised from this video, I'm not that nice to phones,
dataset/train/0_76.wav|even my own phone. But my personal dbrand Grip case has held up extremely well over the years.
dataset/train/0_77.wav|The buttons are still clicky even after all this time, and my Teardown Skin, which allows
dataset/train/0_78.wav|me to see the insides from the outside, is also still very much intact...mostly. Three and a half
dataset/train/0_79.wav|years is a long time. Dbrand stocks the Grip case for over 50 different models of phones,
dataset/train/0_80.wav|so they have you covered quite literally. The best protection though, is that just
dataset/train/0_81.wav|for 3 pennies a day, this case has protected me from having to buy a brand new $1,200 phone that
dataset/train/0_82.wav|isn't all that exciting. You can grab your own dbrand Grip case down in the video description
dataset/train/0_83.wav|because from the looks of things, it might be a while before Samsung starts innovating again.
dataset/train/0_84.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. This video is tearing Samsung apart, the next
dataset/train/0_85.wav|video is taking Samsung apart – very different. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/1_1.wav|So far up until today, every single folding smartphone has had incredibly complex geared
dataset/train/1_2.wav|hinge mechanisms. For example, if you remember when we took apart the Galaxy Fold 4, there are
dataset/train/1_3.wav|a plethora of metal gears and moving parts that make things super complicated. At least that was
dataset/train/1_4.wav|the case until today. Today Honor is debuting a brand new folding phone called the Honor
dataset/train/1_5.wav|Magic Vs which has managed to reduce the internal hinge components from 92 down to 4. It also folds
dataset/train/1_6.wav|completely flat with no gaps. Today we're going to find out how Honor accomplished this leap in
dataset/train/1_7.wav|the evolution of folding phones, from the inside, taking this thing apart. Which means it's probably
dataset/train/1_8.wav|not going to survive till the end of the video. We should have a moment of silence. That was enough.
dataset/train/1_9.wav|Honor sent over this pre-production unit in anticipation of this global launch. Early
dataset/train/1_10.wav|access to hardware is always appreciated. So huge thank you Honor for sponsoring
dataset/train/1_11.wav|this video. And I really hope you didn't want this phone back. Let's get started.
dataset/train/1_12.wav|The more I see these and the more I play with them, the more I think that my next phone will
dataset/train/1_13.wav|be a folding phone. Unique, versatile, and finally, with this Honor Magic Vs,
dataset/train/1_14.wav|the price is becoming far more palatable. The Magi Vs comes with a 66 watt fast charger,
dataset/train/1_15.wav|which means the battery's probably a dual cell, one in each half of the phone.
dataset/train/1_16.wav|It also comes with a cyan colored case which matches the phone. The one downside
dataset/train/1_17.wav|of foldables is that if you want a case, things get complicated. Yeah, the case protects the
dataset/train/1_18.wav|glass on one-fourth of the phone while open, and when it's closed only four of the eight corners
dataset/train/1_19.wav|get a cushion. But some protection is better than no protection so I'm glad it's included.
dataset/train/1_20.wav|One thing Honor has managed to do that Samsung has not figured out is getting
dataset/train/1_21.wav|the phone to fold completely flat. Comparing the Magic Vs crease to the Galaxy Fold 4,
dataset/train/1_22.wav|it's very easy to spot the difference. My flashlight shines very easily through the
dataset/train/1_23.wav|phone. I believe that Samsung is trying to have a very gentle crease as to not damage
dataset/train/1_24.wav|the inner display. But Samsung only rates their foldability to 200,000 bend while Honor says the
dataset/train/1_25.wav|Vs can handle 400,000 – twice as long. It's more than 100 times a day for 10 years. Folding flat
dataset/train/1_26.wav|also means that the Honor Vs is thinner than the Fold 4 and fits in your pocket better.
dataset/train/1_27.wav|The front screen has a hole punch camera. The inner screen has a hole punch camera.
dataset/train/1_28.wav|And then we have three main rear cameras protruding out the textured cyan colored
dataset/train/1_29.wav|back glass that I'll talk more about once we get inside. I really am going to try to disassemble
dataset/train/1_30.wav|this guy without committing any murder, but you know, sometimes accidents happen.
dataset/train/1_31.wav|A little bit of heat helps soften the adhesive, if there is any. The bumpers I'm removing are
dataset/train/1_32.wav|what allow the phone to completely shut with no gaps, while still protecting the large, soft inner
dataset/train/1_33.wav|screen from getting pinched. It's like having a 7.9 inch tablet in your pants – a two for one. A
dataset/train/1_34.wav|business screen on the front and entertainment screen in the middle. It's also surprising how
dataset/train/1_35.wav|durable, yet extremely fragile the middle screen really is. Taking my razor and slicing through
dataset/train/1_36.wav|the foamy adhesive while in the titanium backplate to the foam body doesn't cause any damage. I can
dataset/train/1_37.wav|lift it up and peel it away in ways that would totally destroy a regular phone with no issues.
dataset/train/1_38.wav|The titanium definitely helps. But as soon as we start removing the second half of the display,
dataset/train/1_39.wav|out of the blue after stabbing it with a razor, it's game over in an instant. With those
dataset/train/1_40.wav|protective bumpers gone the edge of the display is vulnerable. And a poke in the wrong spot means
dataset/train/1_41.wav|it's curtains for the screen. The bumpers are very important. Pretty cool shade of green though.
dataset/train/1_42.wav|For the internal spine of the screen where it curves, Honor has applied vertical metal
dataset/train/1_43.wav|slats. The titatinus slats help keep the fold of the screen focused on one plane,
dataset/train/1_44.wav|offering vertical support while still allowing the screen to move, and of course,
dataset/train/1_45.wav|being lightweight. We also get our first look at one side of Honor's new hinge design. It looks a
dataset/train/1_46.wav|tad more complicated than I was anticipating, but we'll be able to tell more about what's going on
dataset/train/1_47.wav|when we have access to the other side. The phone is still working and can be 100% opperatied from
dataset/train/1_48.wav|just the front screen, but everything's gotta come off if we're going to see what's inside.
dataset/train/1_49.wav|The rear glass has a frosted texture which makes the blue pop and my suction cup pop off.
dataset/train/1_50.wav|There are four wrap-around antenna lines that wrap around each half of the phone,
dataset/train/1_51.wav|which are great for getting clear signal, as well as unintentionally providing me with a
dataset/train/1_52.wav|soft point that I can use to slip my razor blade under the glass to pry it off...gently,
dataset/train/1_53.wav|of course. While we have indeed killed the flexible screen...I say “we” because
dataset/train/1_54.wav|we're all in this together now...there are still a lot of internal parts that
dataset/train/1_55.wav|can be salvaged and used to repair other phones in the future as long as I'm gentle.
dataset/train/1_56.wav|This front 6.4 inch screen has a more normal 21x9 aspect ratio,
dataset/train/1_57.wav|making it slightly wider and more usable than other foldables. And now that the screen is off,
dataset/train/1_58.wav|we can get to screwing. There are two screws holding down the screen ribbon cable bracket,
dataset/train/1_59.wav|and once those are disconnected we find 45 more screws holding down the rest of the guts,
dataset/train/1_60.wav|give or take. Honestly, I lost track around 36. One cool thing though is that the Magic Vs has
dataset/train/1_61.wav|an incredibly reasonable amount of adhesive holding down the battery. Easily pry-able and
dataset/train/1_62.wav|easily removable. I hope Samsung is taking notes. It's also easily the largest battery capacity that
dataset/train/1_63.wav|we've ever seen in a folding phone, so far at least, with 5,000 milliamp hours of capacity.
dataset/train/1_64.wav|14% more than the Galaxy Fold 4, but who's counting. I'll pop out the SIM card tray which
dataset/train/1_65.wav|does have a red rubber ring around the opening. No expandable storage though unfortunately.
dataset/train/1_66.wav|I'll pull out the secondary board which is mostly used to connect all parts from this half of the
dataset/train/1_67.wav|phone with the other half of the phone. We have the internal screen 16 megapixel selfie camera
dataset/train/1_68.wav|on this side. Along with some waterproofing mesh over the loudspeaker opening. The Honor Magic Vs
dataset/train/1_69.wav|does not have an official water resistance rating, but it is nice to see that there are protections
dataset/train/1_70.wav|in place. Taking a look at the left half of the phone, we have a lot more ribbon connections,
dataset/train/1_71.wav|which I can unclip like little Legos. We also now have access to the main rear cameras,
dataset/train/1_72.wav|the bottom of which is the 50 megapixel ultrawide which doubles as a macro camera.
dataset/train/1_73.wav|It doesn't have OIS. We have the 8 megapixel 3x telephoto camera which does have OIS. And
dataset/train/1_74.wav|then we have the 54 megapixel main camera which has EIS, or electronic image stabilization. Then
dataset/train/1_75.wav|again another 16 megapixel selfie camera for the front screen. There are 5 cameras total.
dataset/train/1_76.wav|The motherboard comes out next. It has some thermal goop on the back which helps transfer heat
dataset/train/1_77.wav|from the processor to the magnesium alloy metal of the phone. Speaking of which, I think it's time we
dataset/train/1_78.wav|dissect the hinge to see what Honor is talking about with this new simpler design. To remove
dataset/train/1_79.wav|the hinge support structure we have 15 screws. We also have to pop out the waterproofing dust caps
dataset/train/1_80.wav|on each side for the pass through ribbons. The right side has a cool green waterproofing gasket.
dataset/train/1_81.wav|And the left side has a red rubber gasket. It's feeling like Christmas up in here. Also, forgot
dataset/train/1_82.wav|to mention the rectangular vibrator that sits in the lower end of the back half of the phone.
dataset/train/1_83.wav|And finally, the hinge is free. This is where all the magic happens inside of the Magic Vs.
dataset/train/1_84.wav|I've been waiting all video to say that. I'll remove three more itty bitty screws so we can
dataset/train/1_85.wav|pop off the metal spine since we want full access to the kinetics. What differentiates
dataset/train/1_86.wav|this folding phone hinge from other folding phone hinges is the simplicity. The Magic Vs
dataset/train/1_87.wav|hinge is gearless. Instead of having 92 different support structure components to stiffen the sides,
dataset/train/1_88.wav|Honor has been able to singularly cast these metal components into the black aerospace grade plastic,
dataset/train/1_89.wav|eliminating 92 other small parts in the process. The four structural components are the two black
dataset/train/1_90.wav|pieces and both halves of the center hinge. You can see where the metal pins poke through the
dataset/train/1_91.wav|casting holding them in place. The single casting eliminates the need to have all kinds of junction
dataset/train/1_92.wav|points in the hinge holding components together, and with less parts ends up being 62% lighter than
dataset/train/1_93.wav|last year's. Most importantly, casting the metal components together leaves this with just four
dataset/train/1_94.wav|components in the final assembly, which makes the Honor Magic Vs cheaper to assemble. Springs
dataset/train/1_95.wav|are what keep the phone in the open and closed positions. Looks like a high-tech
dataset/train/1_96.wav|suspension system, compressing under load while the phone travels into its closed position and
dataset/train/1_97.wav|again compressing as the hinge travels into its unlocked open position while keeping
dataset/train/1_98.wav|the force of the folding evenly distributed. Springs are cool. It's also interesting to see
dataset/train/1_99.wav|the laser weld tacks that keep the screws from accidentally backing out over time.
dataset/train/1_100.wav|The Magic Vs definitely has a new take on folding phone hardware. I like seeing the
dataset/train/1_101.wav|innovation, and the more companies keep improving in specs and cost,
dataset/train/1_102.wav|the better it gets for all of us as consumers. Nice work, Honor. Rumor is Honor is going to
dataset/train/1_103.wav|have some big announcements at the Mobile World Congress this year. I'll leave a link
dataset/train/1_104.wav|down in the description so you can check that out, as well as where you can find the current
dataset/train/1_105.wav|pricing on the Magic Vs. Pretty cool of Honor to let us get an early look at what's inside.
dataset/train/1_106.wav|Will your next smartphone be foldable? Let me know down in the comments. And like always,
dataset/train/1_107.wav|thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/10_1.wav|Today is the day we find out if Apple has truly fixed the iPhone 14 design.
dataset/train/10_2.wav|Fingers crossed we might actually get a removable glass panel for the first time in 6 years.
dataset/train/10_3.wav|It might not sound like a big deal, but that means instead of paying $500 to fix a cracked
dataset/train/10_4.wav|panel, it's only officially $169.
dataset/train/10_5.wav|Unofficially, of course, it gets way cheaper.
dataset/train/10_6.wav|But we'll talk more about that later.
dataset/train/10_7.wav|If the rumors are true, your wallet is about to be very happy.
dataset/train/10_8.wav|Speaking of wallets, huge thanks to Ridge for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/10_9.wav|I've personally been carrying a Ridge wallet for the past 4 years and surviving 4 years
dataset/train/10_10.wav|with me is quite the accomplishment.
dataset/train/10_11.wav|I got the Burnt Titanium version and it's held up extremely well considering that I
dataset/train/10_12.wav|keep my keys, Jerry Rig Knife, and wallet all in the same pocket.
dataset/train/10_13.wav|And, of course, my cell phone in the other.
dataset/train/10_14.wav|I have 8 cards in mine plus some cash.
dataset/train/10_15.wav|It's cool to see how my wallet has held up against a brand new Burnt Titanium.
dataset/train/10_16.wav|The new one's looking rather pristine and mine has quite a bit of character.
dataset/train/10_17.wav|The Ridge wallet can hold up to 12 cards and has 30 different styles to choose from, even
dataset/train/10_18.wav|one that combines the wallet with an air tag if you're into that kind of thing.
dataset/train/10_19.wav|All wallets come with a lifetime warranty, and even RFID blocking.
dataset/train/10_20.wav|Ridge also has a cool key case which consolidates loose keys.
dataset/train/10_21.wav|I'll have a link down in the description for an extra 10% off.
dataset/train/10_22.wav|Ridge.com/JerryRig.
dataset/train/10_23.wav|And if you don't like it you can always send it back within 45 days for a full refund.
dataset/train/10_24.wav|Now it's time to see what's inside of the iPhone 14.
dataset/train/10_25.wav|Let's get started.
dataset/train/10_26.wav|I'm actually kind of excited for this one.
dataset/train/10_27.wav|Apple has been the same for so long, finally having a new design to check out is rather
dataset/train/10_28.wav|energizing, especially since now it'll be less expensive for people to fix and I'm all
dataset/train/10_29.wav|about that life.
dataset/train/10_30.wav|Speaking of fixing, we still have the two pentalobe screws at the bottom, and yes, I
dataset/train/10_31.wav|do indeed have the new tool sweeping YouTube, but Linus's driver is far too large for my
dataset/train/10_32.wav|application and we'll have to save the full review for later.
dataset/train/10_33.wav|Until then we'll stick with my tiny tools.
dataset/train/10_34.wav|With the screws removed and the phone turned off we can try taking off the screen.
dataset/train/10_35.wav|Now Apple has set the glass flush with the edge of the frame again, so my normal razor
dataset/train/10_36.wav|blade prying combo move isn't going to work well this time around.
dataset/train/10_37.wav|Professional techs use large suction tools with a cup on either side, or even suction
dataset/train/10_38.wav|hot plates to help facilitate the screen removal.
dataset/train/10_39.wav|Eventually I'll have to get me some of those machines, but today we're just going to roast
dataset/train/10_40.wav|the glass with my heat gun until my fingers melt and yoink up with a suction cup while
dataset/train/10_41.wav|pinning the frame down with the razor blade.
dataset/train/10_42.wav|After which we can cut away the adhesive that surrounds the edges, taking special care not
dataset/train/10_43.wav|to damage any of the ribbon cables that line the left side.
dataset/train/10_44.wav|With the adhesive gone the screen opens up like a book, if you live in the USA.
dataset/train/10_45.wav|And what's underneath the screen is fascinating.
dataset/train/10_46.wav|On this iPhone 14 it looks like Apple is taking a very similar approach that Google used in
dataset/train/10_47.wav|their Pixel line of phones.
dataset/train/10_48.wav|Google has won my most repairable smartphone of the year awards for several years running
dataset/train/10_49.wav|now.
dataset/train/10_50.wav|There's a giant metal mid plate between the screen and the rest of the phone protecting
dataset/train/10_51.wav|the circuits and the battery.
dataset/train/10_52.wav|That metal protection makes screen repairs fairly foolproof and makes me very happy.
dataset/train/10_53.wav|The screen is still functioning after removal which is good.
dataset/train/10_54.wav|To take it off completely there are two y triple zero screws holding down two metal
dataset/train/10_55.wav|plates, which are pinning two Lego-style ribbon connectors.
dataset/train/10_56.wav|And that's it.
dataset/train/10_57.wav|There might be a sensor to transfer over to the new screen, but at first glance it appears
dataset/train/10_58.wav|that screen repairs can be done extremely safely and extremely quickly, assuming, of
dataset/train/10_59.wav|course, that the parts aren't digitally locked to the phone, which is a situation we can
dataset/train/10_60.wav|discuss later.
dataset/train/10_61.wav|Nothing else is connected, damageable, or removable from this side of the phone, so
dataset/train/10_62.wav|the only other access point to the internals would be from the back.
dataset/train/10_63.wav|Moment of truth.
dataset/train/10_64.wav|With a lot more heat and a really strong suction cup I can lift the edge of the back panel
dataset/train/10_65.wav|up and slightly out of the phone, just enough so that my razor blade can start slicing and
dataset/train/10_66.wav|dicing the adhesive.
dataset/train/10_67.wav|Remember, I'm like decently good at opening phones but in, like, the same way you don't
dataset/train/10_68.wav|want a veterinarian performing your appendectomy.
dataset/train/10_69.wav|The job will get done, of course, in both situations, the results are just a little
dataset/train/10_70.wav|less than certain.
dataset/train/10_71.wav|Finally the back glass is detached and opens up just like a book if you live in Japan,
dataset/train/10_72.wav|exposing all the glorious internals of the iPhone 14.
dataset/train/10_73.wav|This is the easiest iPhone back glass removal in a decade.
dataset/train/10_74.wav|The only thing still connected is the wireless charger rear microphone and LED flash, all
dataset/train/10_75.wav|attached through the same Lego-style ribbon cable to that motherboard.
dataset/train/10_76.wav|With the metal bracket removed I unplugged what I thought was the battery, turns out
dataset/train/10_77.wav|what's a bit lower and the back panel is officially on its own.
dataset/train/10_78.wav|Now it's hard to say for certain but we already know that Apple will perform this exact repair
dataset/train/10_79.wav|themselves with genuine parts for $169.
dataset/train/10_80.wav|But I also know people who don't really care about genuine parts and just want a quick,
dataset/train/10_81.wav|cheap, and easy way to keep glass dust from entering their fingertips.
dataset/train/10_82.wav|Right now if you were to buy a Samsung Note 20 aftermarket glass replacement it would
dataset/train/10_83.wav|cost around $20.
dataset/train/10_84.wav|The iPhone 14 is too new to predict cost-wise, but I would assume since it has a metal plate
dataset/train/10_85.wav|and a bit more hardware, the unofficial replacement pieces would be in the $20-30 range and probably
dataset/train/10_86.wav|come without magnets installed, but we'll have to wait and see.
dataset/train/10_87.wav|Taking a close up look at the LED flash, which you would probably have to transfer over to
dataset/train/10_88.wav|avoid any non-genuine part detected errors, it does have a rubber ring around the circular
dataset/train/10_89.wav|lens which makes a watertight seal against the back glass, which means if your glass
dataset/train/10_90.wav|is compromised, so is your water resistance.
dataset/train/10_91.wav|Not sure if this has the 9 individual LEDs built into it for the flash variations that
dataset/train/10_92.wav|Apple was talking about.
dataset/train/10_93.wav|But there are a whole lot of solder points on the back.
dataset/train/10_94.wav|We'll have to compare it to the 14 Pro if you want me to take apart one of those.
dataset/train/10_95.wav|But yeah, huge points to Apple this year for making the two most common repairs on smartphones
dataset/train/10_96.wav|– the screen and the back glass – super easy to fix.
dataset/train/10_97.wav|It's a ginormous step in the right direction for wallets everywhere.
dataset/train/10_98.wav|The last easy thing to replace before we descend into anarchy and chaos is the battery.
dataset/train/10_99.wav|Turns out the connector's under the second metal plate below two more tri-point screws.
dataset/train/10_100.wav|Now the battery is really unplugged and it looks like we have some pull tabs.
dataset/train/10_101.wav| The world would be a better place if every phone had pull tabs.
dataset/train/10_102.wav|But that's all the happiness we get for today though, since our other tab broke and we have
dataset/train/10_103.wav|to use alcohol to drown the rest of our problems.
dataset/train/10_104.wav|The isopropyl alcohol isn't our first choice obviously, but it does dissolve the stickiness
dataset/train/10_105.wav|of the pull tab that's left and lets the battery be removed without bending it or prying it
dataset/train/10_106.wav|since both of those are dangerous to the 3279 milliamp hours of juice left inside of the
dataset/train/10_107.wav|pouch.
dataset/train/10_108.wav|Another bracket with its tri-point screws can be removed up top.
dataset/train/10_109.wav|This gives us access to the front and rear camera ribbon.
dataset/train/10_110.wav|I'll also pop out three screws near that taptic motor for the phone vibrations.
dataset/train/10_111.wav|It came out with the standoff still attached which is definitely not supposed to happen,
dataset/train/10_112.wav|but since I haven't been super nice to the phone we'll let it slide.
dataset/train/10_113.wav|I'll unplug the Lego-style ribbons for the camera units, along with removing the three
dataset/train/10_114.wav|screws that hold the housing in place.
dataset/train/10_115.wav|Up top we have our 12 megapixel ultra wide camera with no OIS.
dataset/train/10_116.wav|And at first glance it appears that the main camera also does not have OIS, but it turns
dataset/train/10_117.wav|out that Apple is again implementing their censorship technology which actually stabilizes
dataset/train/10_118.wav|the sensor of the camera instead of stabilizing the lens of the camera.
dataset/train/10_119.wav|I showed how this works during the iPhone 12 Pro Max teardown.
dataset/train/10_120.wav|It's an interesting piece of technology that gets the same job done, just in a different
dataset/train/10_121.wav|way.
dataset/train/10_122.wav|With the camera's gone we can remove the 5 standoff screws holding down the motherboard
dataset/train/10_123.wav|and then unclip the front 12 megapixel camera and the face ID components.
dataset/train/10_124.wav|Super convenient that these aren't attached to the screen anymore.
dataset/train/10_125.wav|There's another 5 screws surrounding the top loudspeaker circuits along with a very sneaky
dataset/train/10_126.wav|little guy tucked up inside of the frame.
dataset/train/10_127.wav|Kind of annoying but Apple's been doing this kind of thing since day 1.
dataset/train/10_128.wav|With the loudspeaker out we can check it for balls.
dataset/train/10_129.wav|And unfortunately there doesn't appear to be any.
dataset/train/10_130.wav|Now Apple is usually about 5 years behind the curve when it comes to new developments,
dataset/train/10_131.wav|and we only recently started seeing balls inside of most smartphone speakers.
dataset/train/10_132.wav|So I bet Apple will invent sound dampening in about 2 more years.
dataset/train/10_133.wav|They'll probably call it the “iBalls” or something.
dataset/train/10_134.wav|The motherboard is released as well at this point.
dataset/train/10_135.wav|Crazy that the entire brains of the phone is about the same size as a finger.
dataset/train/10_136.wav|It's double stacked and has more power than the computer NASA used to go to the moon.
dataset/train/10_137.wav|But yet, all we do nowadays is scroll 15 second TicToks.
dataset/train/10_138.wav|Our ancestors are probably super proud.
dataset/train/10_139.wav|My iPhone 14 still has a SIM card tray since it's an international model.
dataset/train/10_140.wav|And up to this point, the iPhone 14 is pretty reasonable.
dataset/train/10_141.wav|Yeah, we've seen a lot of different types of screws and a bit of a complex layout, but
dataset/train/10_142.wav|what we've seen so far is nothing compared to what lies ahead in the charging port.
dataset/train/10_143.wav|Every other company usually has about 3 or 4 screws to hold down the bottom boards.
dataset/train/10_144.wav|Apple uses 15, and it's not even a board, it's just a ribbon.
dataset/train/10_145.wav|I wouldn't recommend diving this deep to anyone.
dataset/train/10_146.wav|The happiness we experienced with the back panel is all gone now.
dataset/train/10_147.wav|We have gone far too deep.
dataset/train/10_148.wav|It's like the dwarves in Morya expecting a Balrog to pop out at any moment, and these
dataset/train/10_149.wav|aren't even regular screws either.
dataset/train/10_150.wav|Yeah, we have Phllips, tri-point, and standoff, and even long screws tacking the lightning
dataset/train/10_151.wav|port to the inner wall.
dataset/train/10_152.wav|It's like Steve Jobs once said “screw it” and a designer drew this up as a joke.
dataset/train/10_153.wav|And then they left it in the final version of the phone as a memorial.
dataset/train/10_154.wav|There's literally no other reason.
dataset/train/10_155.wav|Now that we have the completely housing I'm pretty happy with the changes Apple has made
dataset/train/10_156.wav|this year.
dataset/train/10_157.wav|Yeah, the charging port's annoying and a lot of parts could have been streamlined both
dataset/train/10_158.wav|for manufacturing and repairability, but it's not that bad.
dataset/train/10_159.wav|Definitely not as bad as it used to be.
dataset/train/10_160.wav|I would imagine that the people out there with a cracked back glass outnumber the people
dataset/train/10_161.wav|with a broken charging port like 500 to 1.
dataset/train/10_162.wav|So while the internal design is more chaotic than we normally see in a smartphone, at least
dataset/train/10_163.wav|the parts that are most often broken are now easy to fix.
dataset/train/10_164.wav|I think the iPhone 14 screen and back glass are now even more repariable than on most
dataset/train/10_165.wav|Android phones, which is something I never thought I would say.
dataset/train/10_166.wav|However, Apple does have a history of software locking individual parts to the phone, which
dataset/train/10_167.wav|is annoying.
dataset/train/10_168.wav|Imagine your car locking you out if you replace the windshield wipers.
dataset/train/10_169.wav|Same situation.
dataset/train/10_170.wav|But even with that, the iPhone 14 is for sure a step in the right direction.
dataset/train/10_171.wav|And in my opinion, it's the better of the two iPhones released this year.
dataset/train/10_172.wav|Did I have some screws left over?
dataset/train/10_173.wav|Maybe.
dataset/train/10_174.wav|But at least the screen is happy that it's almost put back together.
dataset/train/10_175.wav|With the two silver brackets back in place to your surprise as well as mine, the new
dataset/train/10_176.wav|iPhone 14 from Apple is completely reassembled and fully functional.
dataset/train/10_177.wav|The screen repairs...easy.
dataset/train/10_178.wav|The back glass repairs...easy.
dataset/train/10_179.wav|The rest of the phone?
dataset/train/10_180.wav|Well let's just focus on the positive.
dataset/train/10_181.wav|Nice work, Apple.
dataset/train/10_182.wav|As always, the easier way to see the insides of your phone is with one of my Teardown Skins.
dataset/train/10_183.wav|You get to see all the screws without voiding any warranties.
dataset/train/10_184.wav|I'll leave a link down in the description.
dataset/train/10_185.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already.
dataset/train/10_186.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/10_187.wav|And huge thanks to Ridge wallets for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/10_188.wav|I'm a fan.
dataset/train/10_189.wav|Thanks a ton for watching.
dataset/train/10_190.wav|I'll see you around.
dataset/train/11_1.wav|So I've kind of been making fun of iPhones for, like, a really long time.
dataset/train/11_2.wav|For like basically 10 years now, mostly because they deserved it. But this year,
dataset/train/11_3.wav|this year is different. Rumor is Apple has finally fixed the worst part of the iPhone design.
dataset/train/11_4.wav|Yeah, from the outside at first glance, the iPhone 14 looks just like the 13.
dataset/train/11_5.wav|But the kind folks over at Apple have been working hard all year long changing up the insides. And if
dataset/train/11_6.wav|the rumors are true this new regular iPhone 14 is the best built iPhone in a really,
dataset/train/11_7.wav|really, really long time. Really. It's even built better than the more expensive iPhone
dataset/train/11_8.wav|14 Pro. I might be getting ahead of myself though. Can't count our chickens before they hatch,
dataset/train/11_9.wav|nor can we count the apples in a seed. Not sure where I'm going with that one. Let's get started.
dataset/train/11_10.wav|I'm just going to say it. Apple has changed up the new internal structure of the iPhone 14.
dataset/train/11_11.wav|For the past 9 years, iPhones have been opened up with the screen first, which led to some massive
dataset/train/11_12.wav|repair problems when they introduced the glued shut impossible to repair glass backed iPhone 8,
dataset/train/11_13.wav|with repair costs exceeding $500 when the glass cracked, which it often does. Glass is
dataset/train/11_14.wav|glass – a nightmare for wallets everywhere. All of that though has changed with the iPhone 14.
dataset/train/11_15.wav|Rumor is the screen still comes off on its own for easy replacement of course. But the back
dataset/train/11_16.wav|glass now does the same. The back panel is easy to replace, and officially, straight from Apple,
dataset/train/11_17.wav|only costs $169 instead of the normal $500 for the glued together versions like the iPhone 14 Pro.
dataset/train/11_18.wav|It's cool to see Apple doing something about the situation and I hope it expands into the
dataset/train/11_19.wav|Pro models. This is a big deal, even more so since the aftermarket non-official glass replacements
dataset/train/11_20.wav|will usually only cost about $20 or $30. It'll be a game changer for people who like
dataset/train/11_21.wav|non-broken phones and non-broke wallets. Like I said though, these are just rumors,
dataset/train/11_22.wav|we won't know for sure until we can tear this down ourselves.
dataset/train/11_23.wav|But first, the durability test. With a brand new internal design we need to check out the
dataset/train/11_24.wav|structural integrity. Apple is, of course, using the ceramic shield again which leaves
dataset/train/11_25.wav|extremely faint lines at level 6, and scratches at a level 7. I do think Apple's Ceramic Shield
dataset/train/11_26.wav|is an improvement over normal tempered glass. It's nice that it's also protecting
dataset/train/11_27.wav|the 12 megapixel selfie camera which is right next to the metal earpiece grill.
dataset/train/11_28.wav|Ceramic Shield though is still solidly a member of the glass family and not invincible.
dataset/train/11_29.wav|Preemptive protection is always cheaper than having none.
dataset/train/11_30.wav|On my personal phone I rock protection from my channel's sponsor dbrand. They have a perfectly
dataset/train/11_31.wav|fit tempered glass screen protector, along with a grip case. The rubberized sides have that sweet
dataset/train/11_32.wav|micro-dotted texture and the raised lip to keep the camera bump protected. The only thing better
dataset/train/11_33.wav|than cheaply repairing something is not having it break in the first place. I'll leave a link
dataset/train/11_34.wav|down in the description. Dbrand.com/14 so you can get your phone protected just like mine.
dataset/train/11_35.wav|Alright, where were we? Oh yes, the aerospace grade aluminum.
dataset/train/11_36.wav|Aerospace grade is actual manufacturing terminology,
dataset/train/11_37.wav|which is a bit more founded than Samsung's Armor Aluminum
dataset/train/11_38.wav|since Armor is more marketing jargon than a real life substance. Apple uses recycled aluminum in
dataset/train/11_39.wav|59% of their products, probably since it's cheaper, but also since it has 1/40th the
dataset/train/11_40.wav|carbon footprint of mined aluminum...you know, since it's already out of the ground.
dataset/train/11_41.wav|Plus, Apple buys some of their aluminum from a company in Canada
dataset/train/11_42.wav|which melts aluminum using hydroelectricity instead of burning fossil fuels, all of which I
dataset/train/11_43.wav|can get behind. My iPhone 14 is an international version which does include a SIM card tray.
dataset/train/11_44.wav|Unfortunately the SIM tray is not included in the version headed for the United States. We still
dataset/train/11_45.wav|have the lightning port at the bottom for the time being. The rumored removable back glass is
dataset/train/11_46.wav|back here on the back. It'll be fun to tear this one down and see how it looks from the inside.
dataset/train/11_47.wav|We can make our way over to the camera hump. The iPhone 14 has two cameras back here,
dataset/train/11_48.wav|along with a circular flash. Not sure if this version has the 9 LEDs inside the flash like the
dataset/train/11_49.wav|Pro does. We'll have to find out during that same teardown. We have the 12 megapixel normal camera,
dataset/train/11_50.wav|and the 12 megapixel ultra wide. Apple is again bragging about the sapphire crystal lens cover
dataset/train/11_51.wav|which is still strange. Sapphire should only start scratching at a level 8 or 9,
dataset/train/11_52.wav|but as we can see from the scratches at 6, we know Apple ain't using the good
dataset/train/11_53.wav|stuff. And whatever this is back here honestly just seems to scratch easier
dataset/train/11_54.wav|than their Ceramic Shield on the front. In my opinion Apple should just ditch their impure
dataset/train/11_55.wav|sapphire venture and double down on Ceramic Shield which physically appears to be better anyway. Let
dataset/train/11_56.wav|me know down in the comments if you want to see me test the new Apple Watch Ultra which also
dataset/train/11_57.wav|is supposedly protected with Apple's low-grade sapphire. We can always check just to be sure.
dataset/train/11_58.wav|As for the screen we have a 6.1 inch super retina display. And as we can see from the burn test,
dataset/train/11_59.wav|the pixels start going white after about 20 seconds. And normally I would stop the
dataset/train/11_60.wav|burning at this point, but I haven't had time to mention the SOS calling,
dataset/train/11_61.wav|which is actually kind of cool. If the iPhone 14 is out of service,
dataset/train/11_62.wav|it can like talk to satellites and stuff and get help on the way during an emergency. Apparently
dataset/train/11_63.wav|though, this is a service and it costs extra money. Apple is providing the subscription for
dataset/train/11_64.wav|free for the first two years. But if you get lost or aren't subscribed after that, you can just die.
dataset/train/11_65.wav|I love the burn test. The screen's brightness is permanently damaged after the extended flame sesh,
dataset/train/11_66.wav|and you can see that the OLED pixels never do recover.
dataset/train/11_67.wav|Now for the bend test. With the internal redesign on the iPhone 14, the structure needs to be
dataset/train/11_68.wav|tested. I would hate to have a repeat of the old iPhone 6 days, and not all phones live to
dataset/train/11_69.wav|the end. However, with this new iPhone 14 bending from the back, we don't have any flex whatsoever.
dataset/train/11_70.wav|And again from the front, we still have a rock solid sandwich of glass. The iPhone 14 is as
dataset/train/11_71.wav|structurally sound as last year, even with the new removable panels. Nice work, Apple.
dataset/train/11_72.wav|Apple's one of the largest and richest corporations on the planet,
dataset/train/11_73.wav|so the major steps they are taking towards reparability, sustainability,
dataset/train/11_74.wav|and just keeping their devices around longer gets a thumbs up from me. We'll find out if
dataset/train/11_75.wav|the rumors are true about that back panel with the teardown. So hit that subscribe
dataset/train/11_76.wav|button so you don't miss it. Grab a dbrand grip case for whatever phone you're rocking now.
dataset/train/11_77.wav|Cases do tend to work better before things are broken. And as always, come hang out with me
dataset/train/11_78.wav|on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/12_1.wav|So you've already seen my transparently clear knife...you've also seen my red and blue razer
dataset/train/12_2.wav|knives. You've also seen my metal knife, but you have not seen my neon pink and neon green knives.
dataset/train/12_3.wav|All colors are back in stock like some kind of dysfunctional rainbow. All of them have a solid
dataset/train/12_4.wav|metal design, except the clear one obviously. And I think for the next little bit I'll be
dataset/train/12_5.wav|rocking the pink one in my pocket because real men wear whatever color they want...or woman...you
dataset/train/12_6.wav|know...anybody...anybody can wear whatever they want. JerryRigKnife.com. I'll leave a link down
dataset/train/12_7.wav|in the description. Now back to the task at hand – the Samsung Z Fold 4 tear down. Let's get started.
dataset/train/12_8.wav|Samsung says that this new Fold 4 weighs 8 grams less than the Fold 3. We'll see where
dataset/train/12_9.wav|that weight was lost as well as Samsung said they completely redesigned the internal hinge.
dataset/train/12_10.wav|The mechanism is now gearless. Personally, I think that folding phones are super cool.
dataset/train/12_11.wav|If my 3 year old Note 10 Plus ever kicks the bucket I definitely consider
dataset/train/12_12.wav|considering a folding phone as my next daily driver. Let's clean things up a bit.
dataset/train/12_13.wav|Like any reputable surgeon I only work in the most pristine of environments. If I'm honest, during my
dataset/train/12_14.wav|last few folding phone teardowns, I have given a valiant effort towards removing the folding
dataset/train/12_15.wav|screen in one piece and thus far I have not been very successful. Samsung has again inlaid rubber
dataset/train/12_16.wav|bumpers around the inner portion of the rim. This keeps dust and objects from damaging the edge of
dataset/train/12_17.wav|the display, as well as keeps the screen from getting damaged itself if it ever slams closed.
dataset/train/12_18.wav|There are ribbons under the display that connect it to the motherboard as we see
dataset/train/12_19.wav|from last year's Fold 3. I'm going to try to avoid these as we pull away from the screen.
dataset/train/12_20.wav|The screen is flexible of course. That's kind of the whole point.
dataset/train/12_21.wav|And it's extremely good about folding in one plane, one direction over and over again. Samsung
dataset/train/12_22.wav|estimates that it's good for about 200,000 foolds, which is about 110 folds a day for 5 years.
dataset/train/12_23.wav|First, what rookie only checks their phone 100 times a day? And second, the screen only survives
dataset/train/12_24.wav|that folding motion if it follows the singular plane. The display doesn't last very long at all,
dataset/train/12_25.wav|with simultaneous bi-directional flexes. And once again, as you can see, we are unsuccessful
dataset/train/12_26.wav|in removing the inner screen. Maybe next time. F in chat for our friend.
dataset/train/12_27.wav|The screen is made up of quite a few different layers,
dataset/train/12_28.wav|the coolest of which is probably the golden S pen layer at the back that can sense the location of
dataset/train/12_29.wav|the Samsung stylus. Pretty neat. The other notable part of this new Fold 4 display is that there is
dataset/train/12_30.wav|no metal back plate. Samsung trimmed these 8 grams of weight by shedding some protection
dataset/train/12_31.wav|and rigidity on the back side of the display. They did add some fiber reinforced plastic
dataset/train/12_32.wav|which they say is just as durable, but time will tell. We can also perfectly see here
dataset/train/12_33.wav|the pixel density of the under display cameras from the backside. Substantial improvements on
dataset/train/12_34.wav|the Fold 4. I mean, the camera peering through each of these holes is still only 4 megapixels,
dataset/train/12_35.wav|but it'll be interesting to see where this technology ends up. With the inner display
dataset/train/12_36.wav|now gone, we get our first look at the hinge that holds both halves of the phone together,
dataset/train/12_37.wav|and all of its intricate little components that we'll get to in just a second.
dataset/train/12_38.wav|To reveal the rest of the Fold 4's guts we have to remove the glass display.
dataset/train/12_39.wav|We know it's made from glass by the way it cracks during removal.
dataset/train/12_40.wav|Samsung does make things difficult by inlaying the glass inside of the metal frame,
dataset/train/12_41.wav|not leaving much room for removal tools. The frosted back panel removal is a bit easier.
dataset/train/12_42.wav|It flexes more, enough to get my razor blade underneath, and we can pull it off in one piece.
dataset/train/12_43.wav|The rear wireless charger can be removed without any screws,
dataset/train/12_44.wav|it's just a Lego style ribbon connector. This thing charges at 15 watts, a 4 watt improvement
dataset/train/12_45.wav|over last year, and it's able to reverse wireless charge at 4.5 watts, using the same copper coils.
dataset/train/12_46.wav|We can remove 6 phillips head screws from the top left plastics. I can unplug the battery,
dataset/train/12_47.wav|and 9 more screws holding down the top right plastics give us access to one of the stereo
dataset/train/12_48.wav|loudspeakers. I'll definitely not be counting the balls inside no matter how many likes this
dataset/train/12_49.wav|video gets. With the right battery unplugged we can move over to the power button ribbon,
dataset/train/12_50.wav|and the upper 4 megapixel hidden selfie camera.
dataset/train/12_51.wav|A few more ribbon cables that join up the halves can be popped off, while we also find one of our
dataset/train/12_52.wav|5G antennas. Just a heads up if you're looking to be the trendiest person in your facebook group,
dataset/train/12_53.wav|it's almost time to start dreaming up 6G conspiracies. Six more screws hold down the
dataset/train/12_54.wav|bottom right plastics, which brings our total to 21. We have quite a few more balls inside
dataset/train/12_55.wav|this lower loudspeaker as well. The balls help the speaker sound bigger than it actually is.
dataset/train/12_56.wav|We can unsnap a few more ribbon cables and pop out the SIM card tray before removing the super thin
dataset/train/12_57.wav|secondary board that has the 10 megapixel front camera and removable SIM card slot still attached.
dataset/train/12_58.wav|The bottom right plastics just have 3 screws, with 3 more screws holding down the board itself,
dataset/train/12_59.wav|bringing us up to 27. The bottom board contains the 25 watt USB-C charging port with its red
dataset/train/12_60.wav|rubber ring. We'll get to some more of the water protections here in a second.
dataset/train/12_61.wav|The power button and fingerprint scanner has a ribbon all of its own,
dataset/train/12_62.wav|along with a hefty built in white gasket to help keep water out from this orifice. There are a
dataset/train/12_63.wav|few more ribbon cables and three additional screws holding down the main motherboard.
dataset/train/12_64.wav|We also get a close up look at the 3 main rear cameras. Up top we have the 123 degree ultra wide
dataset/train/12_65.wav|with no OIS. We have the 50 megapixel main camera in the center with OIS.
dataset/train/12_66.wav|And at the bottom we have the 10 megapixel telephoto camera,
dataset/train/12_67.wav|which also has the optical image stabilization, all very normally attached to the board
dataset/train/12_68.wav|using lego style ribbon connectors. Samsung also placed a second 5G antenna inside the frame rail.
dataset/train/12_69.wav|The main things we have left to remove before getting access to the newly redesigned hinge
dataset/train/12_70.wav|are just the batteries. Now, Samsung battery attachment methods have been historically
dataset/train/12_71.wav|annoying. And this new Fold 4 is no different. Smart smartphone manufacturers use pull tabs,
dataset/train/12_72.wav|which is much easier than dealing with adhesive which requires extreme heat,
dataset/train/12_73.wav|alcohol, or extreme cold. Since heat is dangerous around batteries, I'm opting for the alcohol
dataset/train/12_74.wav|which helps dissolve the sticky goo holding the battery in place...kinda. Force is still required.
dataset/train/12_75.wav|I'm taking special care not to bend or damage the exterior pouch of the battery. This first
dataset/train/12_76.wav|unit is a 2,340 milliamp hour capacity. There is a very distinct smell that comes with puncturing a
dataset/train/12_77.wav|battery, almost like burnt Skittles. And it's the second battery where this smell of burnt Skittles
dataset/train/12_78.wav|come into play. This was a bit harder to remove, and I did nick the outer protective layer. Not
dataset/train/12_79.wav|enough to cause sparks or start a fire, but enough that now my office smells of burnt Skittles.Torn
dataset/train/12_80.wav|or bent batteries are very unpredictable and I disagree very much with Samsung's adhesive
dataset/train/12_81.wav|addiction since there are many other better and safer ways of attaching a battery. All batteries
dataset/train/12_82.wav|eventually need to be removed for recycling. So it's nice if Samsung would have some foresight.
dataset/train/12_83.wav|This second battery is a 2060 milliamp hour which brings us to a total of 4400. Same as last year.
dataset/train/12_84.wav|Finally, with the battery rant over we can get a better look at the hinge. Samsung is
dataset/train/12_85.wav|again using the rubbery goop that keeps liquid out from the internal components. Kind of the
dataset/train/12_86.wav|same we saw last year. Just like bathroom caulk and will definitely get the job done.
dataset/train/12_87.wav|We also have waterproofing mesh screens around the loudspeaker openings on bottom and top,
dataset/train/12_88.wav|as well as the microphone openings of which there are several. There is quite a bit going
dataset/train/12_89.wav|on inside of this thing. If you've been keeping track, we've already removed exactly 30 screws
dataset/train/12_90.wav|and when we flip over the Fold 4 to see the refreshed hinge design,
dataset/train/12_91.wav|we find another 40 screws holding the two halves together. With all those screws gone we can see
dataset/train/12_92.wav|that the new hinge is sectionalized with metal plates connecting 3 separate hinge components.
dataset/train/12_93.wav|Last year and each year before that, Samsung gave us a complex construction of miniscule
dataset/train/12_94.wav|little spur gears that help guide open and close uniformly. This time around the metal halves are
dataset/train/12_95.wav|guided through little channels using grooves and joints instead of gears. The center hinge
dataset/train/12_96.wav|consdataset/trains and locks the motion of the two halves as it rotates into itself. It looks like there is
dataset/train/12_97.wav|a darker graphite looking lubricant in here as well, which is important for the metal on
dataset/train/12_98.wav|mental stuff. The top and bottom pieces are rather similar, although I assume these are constructed
dataset/train/12_99.wav|to provide the resistance or holding force to keep the phone open or partially closed. But there is
dataset/train/12_100.wav|still a much smaller channel keeping the whole operation straight. Either way, neither of the 3
dataset/train/12_101.wav|hinge components this time around have any gears. The hinges do look a bit dirty, kind of the same
dataset/train/12_102.wav|color of dirt that I put on the phone during the durability test, but it could also be something
dataset/train/12_103.wav|from the factory. Either way, most importantly though, there are no large pieces of sand or
dataset/train/12_104.wav|rocks rattling around after the durability test, since those would be what caused the real issues.
dataset/train/12_105.wav|After having handled both sets of gears from the inside, I do feel like the geared hinges from last
dataset/train/12_106.wav|year feel a bit better when manipulated on an individual basis. I doubt people will be able
dataset/train/12_107.wav|to tell the difference between the two styles though and we'll just have to see how this new
dataset/train/12_108.wav|design holds up over time. It is nice having no gears or rotating parts, but we are now also
dataset/train/12_109.wav|sliding metal on metal. A squeaky folding phone would cure anyone of their smartphone addiction.
dataset/train/12_110.wav|A few last little tidbits. The magnets are very securely glued into the frame.
dataset/train/12_111.wav|And of course, Samsung still left us with the little brushy sweepy bristles
dataset/train/12_112.wav|that line the inside of the hinge. Overall I think it's fun seeing the
dataset/train/12_113.wav|insides of what probably is the world's most technologically advanced phone at the moment,
dataset/train/12_114.wav|and I'm glad you're here to join me. Next time though Samsung, I think it would be nice to see
dataset/train/12_115.wav|some innovation in the battery adhesion department since we do have to plan for end of life.
dataset/train/12_116.wav|If you want to see the insides of your own phone without it ending up looking like this,
dataset/train/12_117.wav|you can grab one of my Teardown Skins. Link in the description. Dbrand and I cover pretty much every
dataset/train/12_118.wav|major phone and tablet with the exact images of what's on the inside – no screw removal required.
dataset/train/12_119.wav|Are you going to get a folding phone someday or do you already have one? Let me know your
dataset/train/12_120.wav|thoughts down in the comments. I'll leave a link for my two new Jerry Rig Knife colors next
dataset/train/12_121.wav|to the Teardown Skin as well. As the great Ash used to say, “Gotta catch them all.”
dataset/train/12_122.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/12_123.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/13_1.wav|You probably thought I forgot to take apart the world's loudest smartphone,
dataset/train/13_2.wav|but I indeed did not. We've definitely seen the outside. It did survive my durability
dataset/train/13_3.wav|test. But today we're going to find out what's on the inside. Only costing $275,
dataset/train/13_4.wav|I have had a lot of people ask where they might be able to buy this phone, and the answer
dataset/train/13_5.wav|is on the internet. Speaking of which, huge thanks once again to Opera for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/13_6.wav|Opera is one of the OG web browsers from the dawn of the internet that's still around today.
dataset/train/13_7.wav|It's free just like a regular browser, but also includes free ad blocking and a free VPN. You
dataset/train/13_8.wav|know, a virtual private network that secures your internet traffic within the browser itself.
dataset/train/13_9.wav|There's no need to download any additional apps or browser extensions. There's even no login, no
dataset/train/13_10.wav|data limits, or payments of any kind. If we head back over to Amazon we see they do have the AGM H5
dataset/train/13_11.wav|right here for $270. I can buy it of course, or I can save it to a pin board of phones I like,
dataset/train/13_12.wav|or take a quick snapshot with the built in screen grabbing tool. Opera has this feature called pin
dataset/train/13_13.wav|boards which makes it easy to group tabs together for research, or gathering websites for a group
dataset/train/13_14.wav|project. I can keep my pin boards private or share them publicly. I'll share this particular pinboard
dataset/train/13_15.wav|of smartphones that I've tested, or smartphones that I want to test down in the video description.
dataset/train/13_16.wav|Personally though, I like the Opera speed dial, which is the first window that opens
dataset/train/13_17.wav|when launching the Opera browser. It has all of my most visited websites in one convenient, clickable
dataset/train/13_18.wav|spot. The Opera browser is free. I'll leave a link down in the description so you can try it out for
dataset/train/13_19.wav|yourself. And now I think it's time we find what's on the inside of the AGM H5. Let's get started.
dataset/train/13_20.wav|I'm still a little mind blown that this thing only costs $270,
dataset/train/13_21.wav|but maybe we'll find a reason for that low price point on the inside.
dataset/train/13_22.wav|Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing the inside of that large loud center mounted speaker,
dataset/train/13_23.wav|as well as the exterior infrared night vision cameras. The AGM H5 is ip69 water resistant,
dataset/train/13_24.wav|with no visible screws on the outside. So getting in is no easy process. Usually when
dataset/train/13_25.wav|opening up a phone we can try by popping off the rear panel. But when a phone is this robust,
dataset/train/13_26.wav|and ip69 sealed shut, it looks like we have to use the front door – the front screen door.
dataset/train/13_27.wav|Not exactly my best work, but when opening a phone for the first time with no instructions,
dataset/train/13_28.wav|sometimes one phone gets sacrificed so other future repairs can be successful.
dataset/train/13_29.wav|Now that we know what it looks like and how it's attached, I could probably do this again without
dataset/train/13_30.wav|the damage...probably...if I wanted. It's built very similarly to the Pixel series of phones,
dataset/train/13_31.wav|where the screen is adhered to a plate on the midframe,
dataset/train/13_32.wav|with one ribbon passing through that metal plate to connect to the motherboard.
dataset/train/13_33.wav|You gotta admit though that the screen's diffuser looks pretty cool.
dataset/train/13_34.wav|With one screw holding down the bracket over the ribbon cable removed, what's left of the screen is
dataset/train/13_35.wav|now free and we can take out these 16 additional screws holding in the super solid midplate.
dataset/train/13_36.wav|Not too shabby.
dataset/train/13_37.wav|This thick plate is probably one of the reasons why the phone was rock solid during the durability
dataset/train/13_38.wav|test. Plus the plate is also doubling as a massive heat sink for the processor. Next pops
dataset/train/13_39.wav|out the battery, surprisingly only held in place with a metal bracket. No adhesive underneath.
dataset/train/13_40.wav|There is some glue holding the battery to the metal bracket, but this method of attachment does
dataset/train/13_41.wav|allow for easy separation, which is important when it comes time to recycle the phone, and that time
dataset/train/13_42.wav|always does eventually come. Circuit boards have a bit of gold and other precious metals that can
dataset/train/13_43.wav|be reclaimed. But it's a separate recycling process for the batteries. And this 7,000
dataset/train/13_44.wav|milliamp hour battery can indeed be recycled. I'm hoping to make a video on that process very soon.
dataset/train/13_45.wav|With 4 more screws holding down the USB-C charging port board,
dataset/train/13_46.wav|we can lift it away exposing the littlest vibrator motor of all time.
dataset/train/13_47.wav|This tiny guy is probably harvested from way back in the old flip phone days. To get to the speaker
dataset/train/13_48.wav|it looks like we have to remove the motherboard, so I'll pop off a few of the ribbon connectors,
dataset/train/13_49.wav|just like a little Lego and remove 5 more screws. And, of course, take out the SIM and expandable
dataset/train/13_50.wav|memory card tray under its watertight flap. There is a sneaky little ribbon underneath,
dataset/train/13_51.wav|but here is the motherboard with its thermal paste. Pretty common. What's uncommon though
dataset/train/13_52.wav|is the massive 3.5 watt speaker protruding out the back of the phone. The speaker is held in place by
dataset/train/13_53.wav|10 additional screws, and it's interesting when the parts separate we can see the waterproofing
dataset/train/13_54.wav|gasket that seals the gap between the circular speaker and the frame. Not only sealing but
dataset/train/13_55.wav|doubling as a cloudy diffuser for the LED lights that would pulse while playing music.
dataset/train/13_56.wav|The speaker itself is made with rubber and plastic, about what we would expect on a $270
dataset/train/13_57.wav|phone. Not quite the titanium and silk we saw inside of the Soundcore speaker we took apart
dataset/train/13_58.wav|a while back. The speaker unit also has three rear cameras, including the infrared night vision
dataset/train/13_59.wav|sensor. We can also see the infrared diode on the goldish square between the two camera units.
dataset/train/13_60.wav|This is what emits the lightwaves outside of our normal visible spectrum.
dataset/train/13_61.wav|But whose light is still visible to the camera sensor. So it'll show up illuminated on the screen
dataset/train/13_62.wav|even though our eyes can't see the light itself. It's really good technology for security cameras.
dataset/train/13_63.wav|Kind of a fun little phone. If you're looking for something cheap and unique,
dataset/train/13_64.wav|AGM might be the way to go. Let me know what phone you want to see the insides of next down
dataset/train/13_65.wav|in the comments. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/13_66.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/14_1.wav|There are two kinds of people in the world: those who like big phones, and those who like small
dataset/train/14_2.wav|phones. Pixel 6A is definitely geared towards the people who want a pocket sized cell phone.
dataset/train/14_3.wav|It's a littler phone in a little box, with a USB-C charging cable and a USB-A adapter,
dataset/train/14_4.wav|along with a circular SIM card removal tool, and some instructions or something. Today we're going
dataset/train/14_5.wav|to find out if this new inexpensive Pixel 6A, costing only $450, is durable. Let's get started.
dataset/train/14_6.wav|The Google lineup of phones is easy to identify due to their large rectangular camera lens
dataset/train/14_7.wav|traversing the entire back panel. This remains true for the Pixel 6A as well as its larger
dataset/train/14_8.wav|sibling which costs twice as much, the Pixel 6 Pro. Personally though, I think the design is
dataset/train/14_9.wav|ripe for a little spice. They always look so much cooler when my Teardown Skin is installed. And
dataset/train/14_10.wav|don't worry little buddy, you'll get one as well, you just have to go through some things first.
dataset/train/14_11.wav|Let's start with the scratch test. No pre-installed screen protector this time
dataset/train/14_12.wav|around. And since it's not scratching at a level 2 or 3, we know it's not plastic. 5 or 6 would
dataset/train/14_13.wav|be glass, and level 8 or 9 would be sapphire. Google says they are using Gorilla Glass 3,
dataset/train/14_14.wav|interestingly enough. GG3 was released about 10 years ago,
dataset/train/14_15.wav|and of course still being tempered glass, scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves
dataset/train/14_16.wav|at a level 7. I'm not too concerned with Google using decade-old glass chemistry in my opinion.
dataset/train/14_17.wav|Glass is glass. It's never really a matter of if it cracks, more like when it will crack. Cases
dataset/train/14_18.wav|are always a good thing. The scratch resistant glass also protects the 8 megapixel circular
dataset/train/14_19.wav|hole punch camera which is right below the earpiece slit, between the frame and the glass.
dataset/train/14_20.wav|Speaking of frame, it is made from metal. Kind of nice. The volume rocker and power button,
dataset/train/14_21.wav|though, are both made from plastic. The top of the phone has more metal,
dataset/train/14_22.wav|along with two antenna lines. And the right side of the Pixel 6A has even more metal,
dataset/train/14_23.wav|along with a SIM card tray. This guy only has room for a singular SIM card with no expandable memory,
dataset/train/14_24.wav|but does have the black rubber ring around the opening to keep things watertight. The 6A is IP67.
dataset/train/14_25.wav|The bottom of the phone next to the 18 watt USB-C port and lower stereo speaker
dataset/train/14_26.wav|is also metal. One of the things Google has been good at over the years,
dataset/train/14_27.wav|besides collecting every minuscule detail of our lives, is their camera quality. I'll leave
dataset/train/14_28.wav|the images to other reviewers of course, but the 12 megapixel ultra wide angle camera, and the 12
dataset/train/14_29.wav|megapixel regular camera are both protected by an oval of glass. The rest of the rectangular
dataset/train/14_30.wav|camera lens housing is made from plastic, which includes the singular LED flash. At first touch,
dataset/train/14_31.wav|pulling this phone out of the box, the Pixel 6A did feel like it had a glass back panel. However,
dataset/train/14_32.wav|as we can see from the razer blade of truth, the top portion is indeed made from plastic.
dataset/train/14_33.wav|A 3D thermoformed composite to be exact. It still does feel pretty good though to be honest.
dataset/train/14_34.wav|At first glance, the gray gleams and glistens like glass. But with my gleeful grin and gentle
dataset/train/14_35.wav|graze of my guillotine, the goods are gouged with a grating groan. You get the gist. The goal of the
dataset/train/14_36.wav|game, always a gamble, is to gain ingress to the galleries of greatness through graphic genius.
dataset/train/14_37.wav|I gladly inaugurate George the Giraffe,
dataset/train/14_38.wav|whose glamorous gallivanting glow now gathers glory galloping through the galactic giganticness
dataset/train/14_39.wav|of Google. And thus concludes Art Class with Jerry. Pretty good if I do say so myself. There is
dataset/train/14_40.wav|quite a lot of static on the back which collects quite a bit of dust. But if you keep the phone
dataset/train/14_41.wav|carving to a minimum you should be just fine. Fingerprint-wise, I was pleasantly surprised,
dataset/train/14_42.wav|with an optical underscreen fingerprint scanner it was able to read my fingerprint. And even after
dataset/train/14_43.wav|some level 7 deeper groove, I was able to unlock the phone every single time. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/14_44.wav|The display of the Pixel 6A is another place Google managed to bring down the price,
dataset/train/14_45.wav|with a 6.1 inch, 60 hertz, and 1080p resolution. It's a decent step down from the 120 hertz,
dataset/train/14_46.wav|1440p display of the Pro. But to be honest, sometimes it's way nicer to have a dense wallet
dataset/train/14_47.wav|instead of dense pixels. It does last for 10 seconds under the heat from my lighter though,
dataset/train/14_48.wav|which also doesn't really matter much, but don't tell anyone. I've just been igniting phones for
dataset/train/14_49.wav|so long the burn test is cannon. Structural integrity, however, does matter quite a bit.
dataset/train/14_50.wav|And it's a valid prerequisite when purchasing a new phone, especially when it will be living
dataset/train/14_51.wav|in your pocket for the next 2, 3, or if you're incredibly good, even 4 years.
dataset/train/14_52.wav|Bending from the front, this $450 smartphone doesn't give us much flex. Flipping around
dataset/train/14_53.wav|to the back and applying pressure, we do see the display start to lift out of the Pixel 6A housing,
dataset/train/14_54.wav|but then locks out leaving us with no cracks, kinks, or breaks of any kind. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/14_55.wav|Nice work, Google. The Pixel 6A passes my durability test. George says it's time to hit
dataset/train/14_56.wav|that subscribe button if you haven't already and come hang out with us on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/14_57.wav|And now I think Geroge is ready for his well earned award – some brand new clothes. If you
dataset/train/14_58.wav|want your own phone to look as cool as George does, I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skin
dataset/train/14_59.wav|in the video description. We're basically covering all the mainstream phones at this
dataset/train/14_60.wav|point and yours is probably in there. As always, leave any questions or phones you
dataset/train/14_61.wav|want to see tested next down in the comments. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/15_1.wav|So about 6 months ago we durability tested the OnePlus 10 Pro and it did not go over too well.
dataset/train/15_2.wav|Today we find out if the design on this new OnePlus 10T has been structurally improved.
dataset/train/15_3.wav|Although similar, there are quite a few physical differences on this new device, which does give
dataset/train/15_4.wav|me hope that it won't end up in the same shape as the last one. Fingers crossed. Let's get started.
dataset/train/15_5.wav|Taking a close look at both phones we can see where the physical design has been modified.
dataset/train/15_6.wav|While they both still have a large square camera array in the top left corner,
dataset/train/15_7.wav|the LED flash location is different, along with a few of the cameras. OnePlus has also
dataset/train/15_8.wav|ditched the Hasselblad branding this time around. I guess their relationship just became too much of
dataset/train/15_9.wav|a...hassle (ba-dum-ching). We are also missing the mute switch so instead of looking uniquely
dataset/train/15_10.wav|OnePlus, it's just looking like one more rectangular slab of glass. There are also
dataset/train/15_11.wav|no antenna lines with this new phone. I'm not sure exactly sure how they accomplished that one.
dataset/train/15_12.wav|The biggest difference though is probably how much material is running up the side of the phone right
dataset/train/15_13.wav|below the camera lens. If we look at where the 10 Pro snapped earlier this year through that thin
dataset/train/15_14.wav|side rail, it looks like the new 10T has quite a bit more material to work with under that lens.
dataset/train/15_15.wav|The design has more meat and has changed quite a bit - hopefully enough to make a difference.
dataset/train/15_16.wav|There are a few more subtle variations of course, and we can cover those as we move
dataset/train/15_17.wav|through the durability test. We'll just run through the whole thing because if we
dataset/train/15_18.wav|deviate too far from the norm we might wake up people who fall asleep listening to my videos
dataset/train/15_19.wav|and we gotta stay consistent. Lullaby's with Jerry coming soon though... Just kidding.
dataset/train/15_20.wav|I mean, unless. And we still get scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/15_21.wav|The front camera has been downgraded slightly from a 32 megapixel down to a 16.
dataset/train/15_22.wav|It is still a holepunch under the glass right below that super thin earpiece slit. If we make
dataset/train/15_23.wav|our way around the sides of the phone we find that the whole thing is actually made of plastic.
dataset/train/15_24.wav|And now the invisible antenna lines make a lot more sense. I thought this phone was made of
dataset/train/15_25.wav|metal ever since I pulled it out of the box. Up top we've got quite a bit more plastic as well,
dataset/train/15_26.wav|and plastic running down the left side. The volume rocker is made from metal. The bottom
dataset/train/15_27.wav|has more plastic, along with the plastic SIM card tray and no expandable memory. It does
dataset/train/15_28.wav|have a red rubber ring though. The U.S. version of this phone only comes with a rating of IP54,
dataset/train/15_29.wav|meaning like the Nothing Phone, splashes are probably fine, but submersion would be unhealthy.
dataset/train/15_30.wav|The back panel of the OnePlus 10T is etched and feels so smooth it's almost oily.
dataset/train/15_31.wav|Hard to explain. It is made from glass though, and the Moonstone Black is acting like sandpaper to my
dataset/train/15_32.wav|razorblade. The cameras are different as well this time around. We have a 50 megapixel camera up top,
dataset/train/15_33.wav|then the circular LED flash. Thumbs up if you remember his resilience from the last video.
dataset/train/15_34.wav|And an 8 megapixel ultrawide camera right below those. And, of course,
dataset/train/15_35.wav|we lost the telephoto when it got replaced by a two megapixel macro camera. Could have
dataset/train/15_36.wav|just left that circle empty in my opinion. I don't often take pictures of small things.
dataset/train/15_37.wav|Now the OnePlus 10T is about $650 right now which is quite a bit cheaper than the $800 10 Pro.
dataset/train/15_38.wav|And with that lower price point, naturally we get a few downgrades.
dataset/train/15_39.wav|Another one of those slight downgrades is now the screen, instead of being 1440p,
dataset/train/15_40.wav|drops down to 1080p. But we still keep the 120 hz and the 1 billion colors,
dataset/train/15_41.wav|so not too shabby. Plus, it lasts for about 20 seconds under the heat from my
dataset/train/15_42.wav|lighter before going white which means it's AMOLED, and then does not totally recover.
dataset/train/15_43.wav|I am skipping the fingerprint readers because we already know my fingerprints are broken.
dataset/train/15_44.wav|Which brings us to the bend test. OnePlus has done a redesign and had time to fix any
dataset/train/15_45.wav|structural issues, but they've also changed up the entire base material, shifting from aluminum
dataset/train/15_46.wav|to plastic. And at first it looks like all those changes might have paid off. No structural damage
dataset/train/15_47.wav|or cracked glass. So far it's lasted longer than the 10 Pro...at least until we flip it over.
dataset/train/15_48.wav|Same spot, right at the camera lens, which is rather unfortunate. I was rooting for this one.
dataset/train/15_49.wav|And we might as well keep going. Once again the 10T fractures along the same line as the 10 Pro,
dataset/train/15_50.wav|right along the top of the battery. Notice though the screen pulling it's own weight with an almost
dataset/train/15_51.wav|90 degree bend and still in one piece. Wait. I guess going a full 90 is a bad idea. Or maybe
dataset/train/15_52.wav|the screen is actually still fine and it's just the battery ribbons that have come disconnected.
dataset/train/15_53.wav|Speaking of which, while the price of the 10T is lower and some things have been downgraded.
dataset/train/15_54.wav|That's not the case with the internal battery.
dataset/train/15_55.wav|It is slightly smaller at 48,000 milliamp hours, but at 125 watts. It can charge twice as fast as
dataset/train/15_56.wav|the 10Pro which is a huge improvement. It's even rated for 800-1600 charge cycles before hitting
dataset/train/15_57.wav|80% capacity. That's like draining your phone every day for 4 years and still having 80% of
dataset/train/15_58.wav|your original battery left. Battery science is getting super good. So to answer the question in
dataset/train/15_59.wav|the title, did OnePlus fix their latest phone? The answer is yes, they did change up things
dataset/train/15_60.wav|structurally, but not quite enough to matter. A case is probably still a good idea. Remember,
dataset/train/15_61.wav|my reviews very specifically only cover structural integrity and durability. There are many more
dataset/train/15_62.wav|aspects to consider when picking a new phone. And just because the device snaps in half during my
dataset/train/15_63.wav|extreme durability test does not make it a bad phone. Tacos fall apart and they aren't bad.
dataset/train/15_64.wav|And OnePlus can always improve next time around. And I'll be here when they do.
dataset/train/15_65.wav|Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss it. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/15_66.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/16_1.wav|Today we're going to be counting the LEDs inside of the back transparent panel on
dataset/train/16_2.wav|the Nothing phone. Remember, this is what you wanted. Nothing says there are over
dataset/train/16_3.wav|900 LEDs inside of here and today we're going to find out for certain if that is true.
dataset/train/16_4.wav|We've already peeled off the frosting layer over the top leaving behind kind of a yellowish ribbon
dataset/train/16_5.wav|with all of the LEDs lined up inside. I have my camera here and a closeup monitor behind us so we
dataset/train/16_6.wav|should be able to get up close and personal with each and every LED. Let's get started.
dataset/train/16_7.wav|Since I've already removed the glass once this should be pretty easy. No heat necessary.
dataset/train/16_8.wav|Now we are inside.
dataset/train/16_9.wav|Let's see what we come up with. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
dataset/train/16_10.wav|15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
dataset/train/16_11.wav|36, 37, 38, 38, 39, 40. 41,42, 43, 44,45,46, 47,48, 49, 50. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59,
dataset/train/16_12.wav|60. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70. 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78,
dataset/train/16_13.wav|79, 80. 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87,
dataset/train/16_14.wav|88, 89, 90. 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99,
dataset/train/16_15.wav|100. Exactly 100 LEDs around the camera lens. Did not see that coming. Easy to remember.
dataset/train/16_16.wav|Let's get this other little line up here by the glyph interface. We are going to go with...I
dataset/train/16_17.wav|don't know if that's an LED or not. 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110.
dataset/train/16_18.wav|111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120. 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129,
dataset/train/16_19.wav|130. 131, 132, 133...let's make our way down to the bottom of the phone. Here is some more
dataset/train/16_20.wav|of that frosted covering which we have not pulled off yet. It would be interesting,
dataset/train/16_21.wav|since this is a white frosted clear cover, we could probably put whatever translucent piece
dataset/train/16_22.wav|of plastic over top of this that we wanted to get a red glow or green glow. Very interesting.
dataset/train/16_23.wav|Let's keep going. 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140. 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149,

dataset/train/16_25.wav|LEDs in the exclamation point. And now that brings us to the wireless charging LED setup.
dataset/train/16_26.wav|This is the longest one and it should be very interesting. We are at 160. Let us continue.

dataset/train/16_48.wav|486 – far shy of the 900 that we weren't ever promised, but we expected to find.
dataset/train/16_49.wav|Let's see...I think there might be something up here. We're going to pop off the exclamation
dataset/train/16_50.wav|point and we're going to dive a little deeper. What I'm thinking is...I'm
dataset/train/16_51.wav|not sure if this is true or not, but it could be that the LEDs are doubled
dataset/train/16_52.wav|up along each of these strips which would bring us to the 900 that we're looking for.
dataset/train/16_53.wav|And there it is, it does look like there are LEDs on both sides of that strip. So we do have to take
dataset/train/16_54.wav|486 and times it by 2, which brings us to just shy of 1,000. 486 x 2 brings us to exactly 972
dataset/train/16_55.wav|LED lights on the back of the Nothing Phone 1. So 971 LEDs are the benchmark to beat for any future
dataset/train/16_56.wav|backlit LED or gaming phone. Kind of hard to beat almost 1,000 lights. If you want to have a little
dataset/train/16_57.wav|fun, leave a number down in the comments to throw people off who are trying to just cheat and see
dataset/train/16_58.wav|what the actual number is without watching the video. And thanks for joining me on this
dataset/train/16_59.wav|adult style Sesame Street counting expedition. Hopefully we don't do it again in the near future.
dataset/train/16_60.wav|It'll be interesting to see what Nothing 2 looks like. Hopefully we don't have to count those LEDs.
dataset/train/16_61.wav|If you have any questions leave them down in the comments. Or if you got a different number
dataset/train/16_62.wav|than I did while we were counting together, make sure to leave that in the comments as well. Come
dataset/train/16_63.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/16_64.wav|And now that only the true fans of Nothing remain watching this video, I happen to have
dataset/train/16_65.wav|5 Nothings to give away to you guys. I will be giving 2 away on Instagram
dataset/train/16_66.wav|and 3 away over on Twitter. So come hang out with me over there and hopefully you
dataset/train/16_67.wav|are one of the lucky winners of Nothing. And thanks again for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/17_1.wav|Today we are going to take apart the Nothing Phone. But first, and I can't believe I get
dataset/train/17_2.wav|to stay this, a portion of today's video is sponsored by Jurassic World Dominion. Yes.
dataset/train/17_3.wav|So I grew up watching the Jurassic Park movies and the very first time I ever remember seeing one was
dataset/train/17_4.wav|at a department store with a wall of TVs. And the scene that was playing on those TVs was towards
dataset/train/17_5.wav|the end of the movie with the Dilophosaurus. You know which scene I'm talking about. I did stop
dataset/train/17_6.wav|going outside after that one. I've seen all of the movies several times already so I was super
dataset/train/17_7.wav|excited to get special early access to Jurassic World Dominion extended edition, with an extra
dataset/train/17_8.wav|14 minutes of never before seen footage. More dinosaurs, more action, and even an
dataset/train/17_9.wav|alternate opening. You know what's better than one version of a movie? Two versions of the movie. The
dataset/train/17_10.wav|Jurassic World Dominion extended edition is yours to own on August 16th, and I'll leave a link down
dataset/train/17_11.wav|in the description. Even though I have an early copy, they specifically said I was not allowed
dataset/train/17_12.wav|to give away any spoilers. But some of my favorite bonus features that come with the Jurassic World
dataset/train/17_13.wav|Dominion extended edition are the explanations of how they accomplish the special effects,
dataset/train/17_14.wav|especially scenes like this one with the feathered pyro-raptor bursting out of the water.
dataset/train/17_15.wav|Seeing behind the scenes details of how things are made has always been super fascinating for me.
dataset/train/17_16.wav|For me, these movies are more documentaries. The latest chapter in the Jurassic Era is here, and
dataset/train/17_17.wav|for the first time ever you can get the Jurassic World Dominion extended edition digitally, 4K,
dataset/train/17_18.wav|ultra high definition and on blu ray. It is yours to own with the link in the description.
dataset/train/17_19.wav|And huge thanks once again to Jurassic World Dominion. If you need someone to get eaten by
dataset/train/17_20.wav|a dinosaur at some point in the future, I'm sure I taste delicious and I am ready to go any time.
dataset/train/17_21.wav|Thank you Jurassic World Dominion for sponsoring that portion of the video.
dataset/train/17_22.wav|Now it's time to get back to Nothing. Let's get started.
dataset/train/17_23.wav|(Intro)
dataset/train/17_24.wav|I have a few questions as we analyze Nothing from the inside. I'm curious if the aesthetically
dataset/train/17_25.wav|layered internals are all connected under the glass, or if it's many different pieces
dataset/train/17_26.wav|all puzzled together. My LED exclamation point is still not illuminating to show my state of charge.
dataset/train/17_27.wav|But honestly, if that's the only thing not working after the disassembly, I'll consider us lucky.
dataset/train/17_28.wav|Like usual, first things first, we'll turn off the phone and pull out our heat gun.
dataset/train/17_29.wav|Heat helps soften the adhesive between the glass and the phone body. Things are made slightly
dataset/train/17_30.wav|more complicated by the recessed design where the glass is sitting flush inside of the metal rails.
dataset/train/17_31.wav|It just makes cutting the adhesive a bit more difficult. But luckily with enough heat,
dataset/train/17_32.wav|the glass lifts out with just a suction cup and we're able to keep it all in one piece. The back
dataset/train/17_33.wav|glass itself is totally transparent with only a white border around the edge to hide the black
dataset/train/17_34.wav|adhesive along the perimeter. With it removed we can get our first look at the internals,
dataset/train/17_35.wav|and by first look I mean we already saw them but now we see them more. All of the layers
dataset/train/17_36.wav|seem to be made up of their own individual pieces like a puzzle. And it's interesting
dataset/train/17_37.wav|that they are actually only held in place with adhesive. Like the small red video recording
dataset/train/17_38.wav|notification has no screws holding it down, just sticky adhesive, which is curious. Anyone who
dataset/train/17_39.wav|has ever taped something to the wall knows that adhesive on its own doesn't usually last forever.
dataset/train/17_40.wav|The silver screws under the glass are fully functional, all shiney and stuff. These are
dataset/train/17_41.wav|probably the 10 most aesthetically pleasing screws that we've ever seen in a smartphone.
dataset/train/17_42.wav|The screws, of course, hold down the larger plastic segments, but the smaller pieces
dataset/train/17_43.wav|are each still all held in place with adhesive, including the diffusing layer
dataset/train/17_44.wav|over the LED strands, which is surprising. These tiny little LEDs themselves have a bit more
dataset/train/17_45.wav|yellowish warmer tint to them. But if we turn the phone back on and light up the back panel,
dataset/train/17_46.wav|we can see that the diodes that have the diffusing sticker layer removed have more
dataset/train/17_47.wav|of a blueish color hue, which looks great when the LEDs are lit, but when the LEDs are off,
dataset/train/17_48.wav|the yellowness of the strand definitely distracts from the pristine white design.
dataset/train/17_49.wav|We can see why the diffusing layer is needed. Nothing says there are about 900 little LEDs doing
dataset/train/17_50.wav|the illumination back here. And I'm probably going to regret this, but if this video gets 50,000
dataset/train/17_51.wav|likes I'll count each and every one of them so we can get the exact number, you know, for science.
dataset/train/17_52.wav|Underneath another piece of plastic held on with just adhesive is the top loudspeaker.
dataset/train/17_53.wav|The speaker does have a screw holding it in place though so that's not falling off.
dataset/train/17_54.wav|It'll be interesting to see in a few years if anyone has just pieces of plastic rattling around
dataset/train/17_55.wav|under their glass back because I don't personally trust adhesive all that much for long periods of
dataset/train/17_56.wav|time. It does look super cool at first glance though. The earpiece does have waterproof mesh
dataset/train/17_57.wav|over the opening. The exclamation point LED comes off next, also held in place with only adhesive.
dataset/train/17_58.wav|It has a ribbon cable leading us under to a little metal bracket. With the rubber stopper removed,
dataset/train/17_59.wav|the bracket slides over allowing us to pop off the ribbon just like a little Lego. There are quite a
dataset/train/17_60.wav|few more invisible screws hidden under flaps now that we're getting deeper. The first of which is
dataset/train/17_61.wav|at the corner of the bottom loudspeaker plastics. There are three more screws hidden underneath the
dataset/train/17_62.wav|wireless charging flap, and two additional screws hidden under the LEDs near the camera lenses.
dataset/train/17_63.wav|And it was right about here that I realized that we were doing all of this surgery while the
dataset/train/17_64.wav|patient is still awake. I would make a terrible doctor. The wireless charging pad and back panel
dataset/train/17_65.wav|come off in mostly once giant layered piece. At first glance it does seem like the white visible
dataset/train/17_66.wav|portion of the back panel is the actual 15 watt wireless charger, but upon further investigation,
dataset/train/17_67.wav|it turns out that the white portion is just a thin plastic veneer. The actual component
dataset/train/17_68.wav|doing all the heavy lifting is the black covered copper charger underneath the plastic.
dataset/train/17_69.wav|The white stuff on top just makes it look cool. Next off, removing the bottom plastics
dataset/train/17_70.wav|we find the lower loudspeaker. Kind of smaller than we normally see.
dataset/train/17_71.wav|This guy does have a black sticker on top which should be hiding all of the
dataset/train/17_72.wav|internal foam balls. And indeed these little guys give the soundwaves more surface area
dataset/train/17_73.wav|to reverberate off of. The balls make the speaker sound bigger than it actually is.
dataset/train/17_74.wav|The battery inside of the Nothing Phone looks to be held in with just a pull tab. Lifting up
dataset/train/17_75.wav|the tabs and pulling brings back memories of what the phone was sounding like during the bend test.
dataset/train/17_76.wav|So I do think we have found what that strange noise was.
dataset/train/17_77.wav|It was the battery adhesive flexing slightly when the phone was bending. Mystery solved. And also,
dataset/train/17_78.wav|thumbs up to Nothing for making their batteries removable. I do hope Samsung is watching.
dataset/train/17_79.wav|This guy is a 4500 milliamp hour capacity. Lithium batteries are recyclable,
dataset/train/17_80.wav|which is why it's important that they are easy to remove.
dataset/train/17_81.wav|For some reason, both ribbons underneath the battery say Pokemon, but I guess if you want to be
dataset/train/17_82.wav|the very best like no one ever was, you gotta look in some very unexpected places to catch them all.
dataset/train/17_83.wav|I'll pop up some signal wire connections off the daughterboard, which then allows it to come free,
dataset/train/17_84.wav|exposing the remaining components inside the lower half of the phone. We do have some waterproofing
dataset/train/17_85.wav|mesh over the loudspeaker vent, a red rubber ring around the charger, and some water mesh over the
dataset/train/17_86.wav|microphone hole which is nice to see. Even though the phone is only rated for an ip53, which is
dataset/train/17_87.wav|just a light sprinkling, it does seem to have the water protections in place for far more than that.
dataset/train/17_88.wav|There is a vapor chamber underneath the battery compartment, once again extending
dataset/train/17_89.wav|underneath the motherboard. To get that motherboard out there is one additional screw
dataset/train/17_90.wav|and a few wire cables. And then we can see the top half of the vapor chamber with some thermal paste
dataset/train/17_91.wav|which helps excess heat flow from the processor to the copper and then out through the front of
dataset/train/17_92.wav|the phone's display. The camera units are still attached to the motherboard with Lego-style ribbon
dataset/train/17_93.wav|cables. The top 50 megapixel ultrawide camera does not have the optical image stabilization, but the
dataset/train/17_94.wav|main 50 megapixel camera right below that does. And of course, we have the tiny 16 megapixel front
dataset/train/17_95.wav|camera as well. The only thing left inside of the phone now is just the screen. But removing that
dataset/train/17_96.wav|though would kill the phone. And while I might be mean to phones, I am no monster...usually.
dataset/train/17_97.wav|So we're going to leave the screen installed and instact for today so we can see if Nothing
dataset/train/17_98.wav|still turns back on after it's reassembled. Always exciting. Seeing all of the somethings
dataset/train/17_99.wav|that make up Nothing has been interesting. We found more water protection than anticipated.
dataset/train/17_100.wav|And found a whole lot of adhesive holding the dimensionally aesthetic rear components together.
dataset/train/17_101.wav|Time will tell if tht adhesive holds up or not. I mean, if worse comes to worse,
dataset/train/17_102.wav|a bit of plastic falls off and rattles around underneath the glass for a while, it definitely
dataset/train/17_103.wav|wouldn't compromise the functionality of the phone. And honestly, having a rattling piece
dataset/train/17_104.wav|of plastic under the glass would be kind of cool. Makes for a good conversation starter. But yeah,
dataset/train/17_105.wav|if this video gets over 50,000 likes I'll have to count all the internal LEDs. Rumor is there
dataset/train/17_106.wav|are over 900, so please think twice about making me count that high. That is a lot of numbers.
dataset/train/17_107.wav|But there we go. It looks like the phone does still turn on and is functional,
dataset/train/17_108.wav|minus the LEDs surrounding the cameras. I might have nicked a ribbon or something
dataset/train/17_109.wav|during the removal, but if you just don't look at that part, we were 100% successful.
dataset/train/17_110.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/17_111.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/18_1.wav|In front of us today we have a brand new, top of the line, gaming phone called the Black Shark 5.
dataset/train/18_2.wav|For some reason gaming phones tend to be the ones that don't survive my durability tests
dataset/train/18_3.wav|when they should be the ones that do. At least that was the case
dataset/train/18_4.wav|last year. We'll have to see what happens this year. Good news about the Jerry Rig
dataset/train/18_5.wav|Everything Knives though – the blue ones should be back in stock later this week.
dataset/train/18_6.wav|I've had a lot of people asking when they will be able to complete their collection, and the answer
dataset/train/18_7.wav|is very soon. And of course, as soon as they arrive I'll be shipping them out with Stamps.com.
dataset/train/18_8.wav|Huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. I've been using Stamps.com for a few years
dataset/train/18_9.wav|now to ship everything out right here from the comfort of my own home with my regular computer
dataset/train/18_10.wav|and regular printer. I have nothing against people who like to stand in lines of course, it's just
dataset/train/18_11.wav|not really my thing. Plus, a little secret, at Stamps.com you don't actually pay full price for
dataset/train/18_12.wav|stamps. With discounts you can't get anywhere else, like 30% off of USPS, and 86% off of UPS,
dataset/train/18_13.wav|it makes a lot of sense and saves you a lot of cents. So whether you're an office sending
dataset/train/18_14.wav|out paper invoices, or selling things off of Etsy, Shopify, Amazon, or Ebay, or maybe you're
dataset/train/18_15.wav|just a YouTuber selling freaking sweet razor knives. You can be up and running in minutes
dataset/train/18_16.wav|printing official postage for any size letter or package, sending anywhere you would like to send.
dataset/train/18_17.wav|You can even order shipping supplies off of Stamps.com. To get a 4 week free trial,
dataset/train/18_18.wav|free postage, and free digital scale, just head to Stamps.com/JerryRig. Not having to go to the
dataset/train/18_19.wav|post office is nice all by itself, the free stuff and discounts just make the deal even sweeter.
dataset/train/18_20.wav|Stamps.com/JerryRig. And I'll get back to shipping knives as soon as we finish this durability test.
dataset/train/18_21.wav|It's time to find out how durable the Black Shark 5 Pro really is. Let's get started.
dataset/train/18_22.wav|We've never had a Black Shark gaming phone fail my durability test,
dataset/train/18_23.wav|but there is always a first time for everything. Strong phones come and go.
dataset/train/18_24.wav|This Black Shark 5 Pro is hiding a few secrets up its sleeve that most smartphones do not have.
dataset/train/18_25.wav|The first of which is a soft spot for poetry. “Under the ordinary reality, an extraordinary
dataset/train/18_26.wav|journey shall begin. Through the mist and the shadow I conquer with my blade and courage,
dataset/train/18_27.wav|ultimate passion shall I devote. For me, game is real.” I think in it's original
dataset/train/18_28.wav|language it probably makes a bit more sense, but it probably boils down to game is life,
dataset/train/18_29.wav|which is probably true for a lot of people and people who are interested in this phone.
dataset/train/18_30.wav|Inside the box we do get a free protective case which is nice of them,
dataset/train/18_31.wav|along with a SIM card removal tool. Not near as cool as the Nothing Phone's SIM removal tool,
dataset/train/18_32.wav|but they can't all be 10's. The phone itself has a soft touch frosted glass panel on the back with
dataset/train/18_33.wav|some futuristic accents. But to be honest, any phone reviewed after the Nothing Phone
dataset/train/18_34.wav|is just going to have a hard time looking cool. Inside the box is where we find the
dataset/train/18_35.wav|second secret – a massive 120 watt fast charger, which according to Black Shark,
dataset/train/18_36.wav|can get us from 0-100% in just 15 minutes. Obviously we'll have to put that to the test.
dataset/train/18_37.wav|Also, I did check the wallpaper options and this was legit the best one so we're rolling with it.
dataset/train/18_38.wav|Now Black Shark does say that this fast of charging might lower the life of the battery
dataset/train/18_39.wav|as things heat up. And turning on even charge mode would help keep the battery in a more safe
dataset/train/18_40.wav|and stable temperature range while charging. But they also say that the battery has more than
dataset/train/18_41.wav|1,200 charge cycles so we should be fine. It'll be interesting to see what the chemistry of the
dataset/train/18_42.wav|battery is when we open it up from the inside. Testing how long it takes the battery to go from
dataset/train/18_43.wav|0-100% while charging at an unthrottled 120 watts is unsettling. At 5 minutes, we're already at 40%
dataset/train/18_44.wav|and the phone is definitely getting warm. It was about the 10 minute mark when we hit 75%
dataset/train/18_45.wav|and the phone is feeling extremely hot, like almost uncomfortable to hold level of hot.
dataset/train/18_46.wav|Now unfortunately, once that 15 minute time limit ticked over, we were only at 95%,
dataset/train/18_47.wav|and it took until just shy of 17 minutes to hit the full 100%. Missed the goal by a few minutes,
dataset/train/18_48.wav|but still very impressive. Something unimpressive, however, is on the back.
dataset/train/18_49.wav|Historically speaking, gaming phones have all had some distinguishing RGB LED's to light things up.
dataset/train/18_50.wav|Since we know nothing improves a gamer score quite like pulsing lights, however, shrinkflation has
dataset/train/18_51.wav|it extra hard this year in the LED department, leaving Black Shark with nothing more than a
dataset/train/18_52.wav|glorified multicolored notification mark on the back. Not even their logo is lit up. Once again,
dataset/train/18_53.wav|hard to compete with the Nothing Phone and its hundreds of LEDs. Personally, I just think that
dataset/train/18_54.wav|all gaming phones should be lit up brighter than a Christmas tree, so it's disappointing.
dataset/train/18_55.wav|One major advantage that this gaming phone has over other gaming phones are the hidden
dataset/train/18_56.wav|magnetic, and might I add, very satisfying, pop up retractable physical corner triggers.
dataset/train/18_57.wav|There is a sound animation each time the button is released,
dataset/train/18_58.wav|and the button can't be released if it's held down in place.
dataset/train/18_59.wav|But it is a pretty cool feature. The trigger doubles as a screenshot taker tool.
dataset/train/18_60.wav|It'll definitely be interesting to see how they work from the inside.
dataset/train/18_61.wav|But of course, first the durability test and the Mohs scale of hardness. I promise someday I won't
dataset/train/18_62.wav|be caught off guard by the preinstalled plastic screen protectors, but today is not that day.
dataset/train/18_63.wav|After the plastics are removed we can continue up the scale. Glass scratches at a 5 or 6, and
dataset/train/18_64.wav|sapphire would scratch at an 8 or 9. We haven't seen a sapphire phone in quite a long while.
dataset/train/18_65.wav|This Black Shark 5 Pro scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. There is a 16
dataset/train/18_66.wav|megapixel hole punch selfie camera also under the front glass, just below the super thin earpiece
dataset/train/18_67.wav|speaker. Is it just me or does this kitten add a strange level of guilt to the durability test?
dataset/train/18_68.wav|Analyzing the sides is where we get a closer look at the metal physical clicky trigger buttons,
dataset/train/18_69.wav|along with the metal textured slider that unlocks the magnetic mechanism.
dataset/train/18_70.wav|We also have the scratchable fingerprint scanning power button. Damaging this will probably come
dataset/train/18_71.wav|back to bite us later. And we have another physical metal trigger up in the top corner.
dataset/train/18_72.wav|The top of the phone has more metal, along with one of the stereo loudspeakers. The left side has
dataset/train/18_73.wav|a metal volume rocker, with a lot more metal. Moving to the bottom of the phone, we have our
dataset/train/18_74.wav|second stereo loudspeaker, along with the 120 watt USB-C port. Which as a bonus, when you plug in the
dataset/train/18_75.wav|phone it's able to bypass the battery altogether so you can run the phone on wall power without
dataset/train/18_76.wav|adding any cycles or drain to the battery. We have our dual SIM card tray but no expandable memory,
dataset/train/18_77.wav|and no IP rating. And unfortunately, with frosted glass there is also no Art Class with Jerry.
dataset/train/18_78.wav|The camera units, however, are rather impressive. Up here we have the 13 megapixel ultra wide
dataset/train/18_79.wav|camera, with a 108 megapixel camera in the middle, and a 5 megapixel telephoto down at the bottom,
dataset/train/18_80.wav|all protected by glass. The bottom flash area though, is made from plastic, which is a little
dataset/train/18_81.wav|unique since everything else is glass, but also not a big deal. Flipping the phone around again,
dataset/train/18_82.wav|totally forgot about Mittens over here, the Black Shark 5 Pro is rocking a 6.7 inch 1080p
dataset/train/18_83.wav|144htz refresh rate and 720htx touch sensitivity rate, which is important for gaming. And also the
dataset/train/18_84.wav|reason Mittens here is tugging at our heartstrings so much is because it's a 10 bit with 1 billion
dataset/train/18_85.wav|colors OLED panel and lasted for about 25 seconds before going white and mostly recovering. Now I'm
dataset/train/18_86.wav|not really sure why I do the fingerprint scanner tests anymore since none of them lately are
dataset/train/18_87.wav|functioning well with my fingerprints. Although to be fair, we did scratch this one up beforehand.
dataset/train/18_88.wav|It is side mounted on the power button where I like them, but it's unable to set or recognize
dataset/train/18_89.wav|my fingerprint, neither with my thumb nor my pointer finger, so take that how you will.
dataset/train/18_90.wav|Now for the bend test. Mittens doesn't get a pass just because it's cute. And plus,
dataset/train/18_91.wav|I don't even really like cats. Bending from the back there is a decent amount of flex once again
dataset/train/18_92.wav|near that antenna line, kind of like we saw on the Nothing Phone. And bending from the front
dataset/train/18_93.wav|we get a whole hole appearing between the frame and the glass, with some substantial separation.
dataset/train/18_94.wav|But the Black Shark 5 Pro locks out without any cracking or actual breaking.
dataset/train/18_95.wav|Mittens and her physical buttons survive this round.
dataset/train/18_96.wav|Nice work, Black Shark. It'll be fun to see how those magnetic triggers work from the inside,
dataset/train/18_97.wav|especially since Black Shark says they can survive for over 1 million presses. Someone, not me,
dataset/train/18_98.wav|should count those. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already so you don't miss it. Come
dataset/train/18_99.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/19_1.wav|The Nothing Phone. In a world of boring rectangles, Nothing is here to save us.
dataset/train/19_2.wav|It's got a box made of recycled fibers that opens like a pack of bubble gum.
dataset/train/19_3.wav|The $400 midrange nothing phone is designed to stand out and look very different...starting
dataset/train/19_4.wav|with the SIM card removal tool – transparently
dataset/train/19_5.wav|unique. The USB-C charging cable is a bit more routine, but then we have the phone itself.
dataset/train/19_6.wav|Nothing quite prepares you for the cleanliness of seeing this thing in person.
dataset/train/19_7.wav|However, it won't be pristine for long. Let's get started.
dataset/train/19_8.wav|I'm a huge fan of transparent phones, and while this Nothing Phone 1 might not be showing off the
dataset/train/19_9.wav|actual internals, it does add a lot of depth and individuality to the design. Nothing, of course,
dataset/train/19_10.wav|needs to make sense back here, it's all aesthetic. But you can see the textures and layers along with
dataset/train/19_11.wav|these subtle metal accents, like these silver torx head screws that dot the phone underneath
dataset/train/19_12.wav|the glass. And it looks like they're actually holding things together. We'll have to check
dataset/train/19_13.wav|on that for sure during the teardown. It's not all about depth and textures though, it's also
dataset/train/19_14.wav|luminescent, smooth, smokey strips underneath the glass turn into very brightly lit
dataset/train/19_15.wav|LED bars. Bright enough to make the RGB gaming phones, that cost twice as much,
dataset/train/19_16.wav|look like little children's nightlights. Nothing has some next level illumination.
dataset/train/19_17.wav|The lights are used for notifications and phone calls. There are supposedly 900
dataset/train/19_18.wav|little LEDs underneath these diffuse strips, which is enough to catch anyone's attention.
dataset/train/19_19.wav|I've seen on other videos that the exclamation point at the bottom is supposed to show how much
dataset/train/19_20.wav|charge is left, but with my particular unit, I tried on 4 different chargers and was not able
dataset/train/19_21.wav|to get that particular feature working, even though my phone is only partially charged.
dataset/train/19_22.wav|That's fine though. We'll have to come back to the back in a minute. It's time for the front.
dataset/train/19_23.wav|Flipping this phone over makes it look like just a regular smartphone again.
dataset/train/19_24.wav|It does have a preinstalled plastic screen protector which is kind of them. Plastic
dataset/train/19_25.wav|screen protectors don't last forever, so we'll test the hardness of the screen underneath.
dataset/train/19_26.wav|A plastic screen would scratch at a level 2 or 3. Glass would be a 5 or 6, and sapphire would be a
dataset/train/19_27.wav|level 8 or 9. And as we can see, this phone does not have much wobble to it during the scratches,
dataset/train/19_28.wav|but we do start seeing scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. Pretty
dataset/train/19_29.wav|normal. There is Gorilla Glass on both the front and back of the Nothing 1. This means
dataset/train/19_30.wav|that the front facing 6 megapixel hole punch camera will also be protected by that glass.
dataset/train/19_31.wav|Glass is glass though, as we know, so if you're looking for more long-term protection
dataset/train/19_32.wav|that's better than Nothing's preinstalled plastics, my channel's sponsor dbrand has
dataset/train/19_33.wav|you covered with an easy to install glass protection that's made from real glass.
dataset/train/19_34.wav|Link is down in the description. Where was I? Oh yeah...Nothing. As we rotate Nothing to the sides,
dataset/train/19_35.wav|we find that the iPhone...sorry, Nothing Phone, is made from aluminum.
dataset/train/19_36.wav|One hundred percent recycled aluminum to be exact. Even the large power button is made from metal.
dataset/train/19_37.wav|Going up to the top we have a microphone hole along with
dataset/train/19_38.wav|more metal. Dropping down to the left side, we get more aluminum,
dataset/train/19_39.wav|along with the individual metal volume buttons. The bottom is where we find
dataset/train/19_40.wav|our metal SIM card tray, 33 watt USB-C port, and our bottom stereo loudspeaker.
dataset/train/19_41.wav|The dual SIM card tray does have a red rubber ring around the opening, the phone itself is still only
dataset/train/19_42.wav|rated at ip53...which is basically nothing. It might be fine in the gentlest drizzles of rain,
dataset/train/19_43.wav|but that's about it. With how dry all the lakes are getting though,
dataset/train/19_44.wav|soon we won't have to worry about anything getting wet, so Nothing is just ahead of the curve.
dataset/train/19_45.wav|The back panel of nothing is made with smooth, clear, transparent glass.
dataset/train/19_46.wav|Making our way up to the dual cameras, we have a 50 megapixel wide angle,
dataset/train/19_47.wav|and another 50 megapixel regular camera. Both are also protected with glass. I'll leave the
dataset/train/19_48.wav|image quality and software analysis to other reviewers, we're just sticking to hardware.
dataset/train/19_49.wav|Back around to the front again with its equally proportioned bezels. The Nothing Phone is rocking
dataset/train/19_50.wav|a 6.5 inch, 1080p, 10 bit, 120 hertz display. And as we can tell from the 40 seconds under the heat
dataset/train/19_51.wav|from my lighter, it is OLED, going white, yet still mostly recovering. Now as far as security
dataset/train/19_52.wav|goes, it does have a face unlock feature, as well as an underscreen optical fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/19_53.wav|Unfortunately though, Nothing was unable to complete my enrollment. I don't always have the
dataset/train/19_54.wav|best luck with optical scanners. I am remodeling a new shop, which I'll show you guys very soon,
dataset/train/19_55.wav|and optical fingerprint scanners just don't seem to be built for people with worn out fingerprints.
dataset/train/19_56.wav|I failed to scan in 2 times in a row, so that part doesn't work too good.
dataset/train/19_57.wav|Which brings us to the bend test. The phone is cheaper than most and prettier than most,
dataset/train/19_58.wav|but that doesn't mean nothin' if it can't hold up to the test of time.
dataset/train/19_59.wav|Bending from the front we do have some pretty concerning flex, but no damage yet. Bending from
dataset/train/19_60.wav|the back feels super solid. Rotating around to the front again, there's that same weird sound
dataset/train/19_61.wav|and some separation along the antenna line, but still nothing from the back.
dataset/train/19_62.wav|Listen closely, it's kind of crazy.
dataset/train/19_63.wav|The phone is definitely moving internally making a bunch of noise as stress is applied.
dataset/train/19_64.wav|And we can see that stress focusing on the antenna line, but it does lock out and stay in one piece.
dataset/train/19_65.wav|Rather narrowly escaping destruction. Nothing better thank their lucky ducks that it locked out,
dataset/train/19_66.wav|because this has probably been the closest a phone has been to breaking
dataset/train/19_67.wav|without actually breaking. Hopefully next year those antenna lines are fortified
dataset/train/19_68.wav|or it's going to get real awkward when we get Nothing Squared.
dataset/train/19_69.wav|If you enjoy having a unique looking phone but don't like spending lots of money,
dataset/train/19_70.wav|dbrand is bringing Nothing to the real world with Something, by now letting every phone look like
dataset/train/19_71.wav|Nothing. Aesthetically updating your current phone is always cheaper than buying a new one,
dataset/train/19_72.wav|so I'll leave a link down in the description so you can grab a Something Skin for your own phone.
dataset/train/19_73.wav|Or, even better, a grip case if you'd like Something to protect your own device.
dataset/train/19_74.wav|Personally, I'm not ready to upgrade my 3 year old Note 10 Plus just yet, but when I am,
dataset/train/19_75.wav|with seeing how unique and sustainable Nothing is attempting to be, when it does come time to
dataset/train/19_76.wav|upgrade I'll definitely be checking to see what Nothing has to offer. Maybe we'll have to count
dataset/train/19_77.wav|those 900 LEDs during the teardown video. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't
dataset/train/19_78.wav|already so you don't miss it. Grab a Something Skin with a link down in the description. And
dataset/train/19_79.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/2_1.wav|Don't mind me today. I'm just getting a little snack before we commence the durability test.
dataset/train/2_2.wav|Today we're going to be checking out our very first e-ink tablet called the Kindle Scribe. It is
dataset/train/2_3.wav|the very first e-ink tablet for both reading and writing. And I did buy two of them...you know what
dataset/train/2_4.wav|that means . I think it even has a stylus inside which should be pretty interesting to
dataset/train/2_5.wav|see how that works. This video is not sponsored by Amazon even though Kindle is owned by Amazon. This
dataset/train/2_6.wav|video is sponsored by Huel. But don't worry, it takes less than 60 seconds to make a nutritionally
dataset/train/2_7.wav|complete, affordable, vanilla shake with 40 grams of plant based protein. It's not just protein
dataset/train/2_8.wav|either, the shake has 27 vitamins and minerals. I mean, just look at the list of all these nutrients
dataset/train/2_9.wav|on the back, plus no artificial sweeteners. Huel Black is an easy way to maintain and
dataset/train/2_10.wav|keep track of your nutritional goals. I've lost 15 pounds since last June, thanks for noticing,
dataset/train/2_11.wav|all thanks to keeping track of my calories and, of course, my daily workout of snapping phones in
dataset/train/2_12.wav|half. New year, new me...you know how it goes. And Huel Black has a 12 month shelf life. Personally I
dataset/train/2_13.wav|like the vanilla flavor, but I have not yet tried the cookies and cream or strawberry shortcake
dataset/train/2_14.wav|yet. I'll be getting those next to spice things up. I like it because it's not super sweet like
dataset/train/2_15.wav|you might see with some other protein powders. If you want your own plant based, affordable,
dataset/train/2_16.wav|nutritionally complete food. I'll leave a link down in the description. But you don't have to
dataset/train/2_17.wav|take my word for it. Over 270 million meals have been sold in over 100 countries. You'll
dataset/train/2_18.wav|even get a free t-shirt with your order. And huge thanks to Huel for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/2_19.wav|Now that I've refueled with my healthy vanilla shake from Huel, it's time to see if an e-ink
dataset/train/2_20.wav|tablet can survive a durability test. It should be interesting. Let's get started.
dataset/train/2_21.wav|Now, tablets with e-ink displays have been around
dataset/train/2_22.wav|for a really long time and are actually fairly priced.
dataset/train/2_23.wav|It's easy to find them for less than $100. This guy, however, the Kindle Scribe with the stylus,
dataset/train/2_24.wav|costs quite a bit more, sitting right around $370. The stylus and power cable are joined together,
dataset/train/2_25.wav|but at that price point we are up in the iPad territory, so let's see if the cost is worth it.
dataset/train/2_26.wav|This is my first experience with an e-ink display this large, and I guess the main difference
dataset/train/2_27.wav|between electronic ink and regular IPS or OLED is that e-ink is grayscale and has basically no
dataset/train/2_28.wav|refresh rate...ever...unless it's time to turn the page. The unrefreshing screen is what gives
dataset/train/2_29.wav|us a battery life that's calculated in weeks instead of days. It comes in 16 shades of gray,
dataset/train/2_30.wav|I guess 50 shades costs extra, and it actually does a pretty good job of displaying images,
dataset/train/2_31.wav|in black and white of course. The 10.2 inch screen has a density of 300 pixels per inch,
dataset/train/2_32.wav|which is about the same as what we saw in the iPhone 11 so there's pretty solid
dataset/train/2_33.wav|clarity. Plus going into dark mode inverts the colors, not only for easy night reading,
dataset/train/2_34.wav|but also some vision impairments can see white text on black pages better. So I can see this
dataset/train/2_35.wav|feature being very useful since most regular books are printed black on white. The matte screen also
dataset/train/2_36.wav|reduces glare. It does feel like glass, but we'll have to find out here in just a second.
dataset/train/2_37.wav|If I rotate the tablet top to bottom, the screen does refresh itself by not
dataset/train/2_38.wav|only inverting the page but also inverting the coloring of each pixel quickly before returning
dataset/train/2_39.wav|back to normal again. Like a really expensive Etch-a-Sketch. It happens both while reading a
dataset/train/2_40.wav|book or if you're scrolling through the e-book library. Not a bad little unit. I can see it
dataset/train/2_41.wav|being extremely useful for the type of person who wants to carry thousands of books around.
dataset/train/2_42.wav|I was surprised to learn, however, that even though you might purchase a book from Amazon,
dataset/train/2_43.wav|you don't actually own it. You're only buying permission to read the title – the title's
dataset/train/2_44.wav|not actually yours. So there is some merit to just getting a physical copy. But then again,
dataset/train/2_45.wav|it all just goes back to how many books you want in your pants – everyone's different.
dataset/train/2_46.wav|It's also surprising to see that the matte screen is also made from plastic,
dataset/train/2_47.wav|with scratches appearing at a level 3 and deeper grooves at a level 4. It's definitely not glass.
dataset/train/2_48.wav|There is no camera on this unit, which is nice. The real differentiator from this e-ink e-reader
dataset/train/2_49.wav|from others is the stylus. It's got a removable tip and the ability to take notes – not directly
dataset/train/2_50.wav|on the page itself however, but as a small Post-it note type thing that's saved as an
dataset/train/2_51.wav|icon wherever you're inserting the note. Pressing the button on the sides allows
dataset/train/2_52.wav|me to highlight instead of write. This would definitely be more useful on PDFs or forms
dataset/train/2_53.wav|which the scribe can also do. While taking notes, however, fingers cannot do any of the drawings,
dataset/train/2_54.wav|and I think we should find out why, especially since this stylus supposedly never needs to be
dataset/train/2_55.wav|charged and has no internal batteries of its own. How does the screen know where the stylus is at?
dataset/train/2_56.wav|It's all done with very similar technology to what we find in Samsung's s-pen stylus. A coil of
dataset/train/2_57.wav|copper wires around the tip that can accurately be detected by a wire mesh behind the pixels.
dataset/train/2_58.wav|In the far end of the stylus, near the digital eraser, we find some magnets whose only job is
dataset/train/2_59.wav|to hold the pen to the edge of the tablet. I kind of forgot to show this beforehand so
dataset/train/2_60.wav|just use your imagination to see the rest of the pen still attached. The body of the e-ink
dataset/train/2_61.wav|e-reader is pretty simple. Bare metal on the right side and bare metal on the top side. I
dataset/train/2_62.wav|guarantee there's a grandma who's watching right now for the first time and is very confused.
dataset/train/2_63.wav|On the left side we have the USB-C port which you won't be using much since a single charge can last
dataset/train/2_64.wav|up to three months. We also have a metal power button all made with 100% recycled aluminium.
dataset/train/2_65.wav|Thumbs up for that. Nice work, Kindle.
dataset/train/2_66.wav|The bottom of the Scribe is also metal and there are some interesting features on the back. Little
dataset/train/2_67.wav|rubber footpads in each corner which are actually quite nice. Very securely attached to the panel,
dataset/train/2_68.wav|and they do a very good job of elevating the reader when it's set down. A slightly more quality
dataset/train/2_69.wav|experience than just having the bare metal rest on a table or desk – kind of like built in coasters.
dataset/train/2_70.wav|It's pretty impressive that in a span of about 600 years, we went from Gutenberg's printing
dataset/train/2_71.wav|press making books one handset letter at a time, to a lightweight internet connected e-ink e-reader
dataset/train/2_72.wav|that can instantly pick from 13 million different titles. Technology changes pretty fast. The Scribe
dataset/train/2_73.wav|is pretty cool and definitely has its place, but I don't think that physical books are going anywhere
dataset/train/2_74.wav|anytime soon. I know the biggest question on your mind when clicking on this video is what
dataset/train/2_75.wav|happens to an electronic ink display during the bend test and let's find out. We know that LCDs
dataset/train/2_76.wav|go black and usually recover. OLEDs go white and usually don't recover. And e-ink...well, it looks
dataset/train/2_77.wav|like this e-ink display does nothing under the heat from my lighter. There is a slight ripple
dataset/train/2_78.wav|of melted plastic on the top, but the screen itself is unfazed and undamaged. I'm impressed.
dataset/train/2_79.wav|The picture you keep seeing by the way is a sculpture on a hilltop in Ohio that the author
dataset/train/2_80.wav|thinks was made by a very advanced civilization on earth about 10,000 years ago which got wiped out
dataset/train/2_81.wav|at the end of the last Ice Age. I'm not normally a conspiracy theorist, but this one's actually
dataset/train/2_82.wav|pretty interesting. And with a tablet this thin, the bend test should also be interesting.
dataset/train/2_83.wav|With the price of an iPad, let's hope this Kindle Scribe is durable.
dataset/train/2_84.wav|You gotta admit, that was some pretty hefty flex, with some serpent-like curvature. Yet,
dataset/train/2_85.wav|the e-ink display is still totally functional. The frame is a bit crinkly now,
dataset/train/2_86.wav|but catastrophic damage has occurred so far. Super impressive. Bending from the front, however,
dataset/train/2_87.wav|yields different results. While no physical cracks have appeared, it does look like half the display
dataset/train/2_88.wav|is now unresponsive. Black and white streaks running down from the right side corners, but
dataset/train/2_89.wav|the left half of the tablet is still displaying text, although unresponsive. Let's find out why.
dataset/train/2_90.wav|Taking off the back cover is easy enough. No screws or glue to worry about.
dataset/train/2_91.wav|The dual cell battery takes up most of the real estate inside of this thing – all 3,000 milliamp
dataset/train/2_92.wav|hours of it. The rest of the guts include the motherboard and a rather thick display. Apparently
dataset/train/2_93.wav|this thing is backlit with 35 LEDs that shine through the e-ink to illuminate the pixels at
dataset/train/2_94.wav|night. Very similar to the QLED technology we see on Samsung TVs, but illuminating grayscale
dataset/train/2_95.wav|instead of colors. Separating the outer plastic from the pixels reveals that there is actually
dataset/train/2_96.wav|quite a bit of glass inside so the screens are crackable even if glass isn't on the exterior.
dataset/train/2_97.wav|There is one additional layer between us and the pixels, which are still amazingly turned on.
dataset/train/2_98.wav|These 16 shades of gray don't mess around. Apparently when the pixels are flipped to black
dataset/train/2_99.wav|or white they stay in that orientation forever, even in death this e-ink display is taking its job
dataset/train/2_100.wav|seriously. The words and letters are permanently etched onto the tablet's surface. Scratching
dataset/train/2_101.wav|past the layers of pixels we can see a copper mesh that's used to find the stylus. Regular
dataset/train/2_102.wav|Kindles that don't have a stylus would also not have this mesh. It's very, very interesting.
dataset/train/2_103.wav|I hope any grandmas passing by haven't entirely lost their faith in this new generation. We do
dataset/train/2_104.wav|the durability test for science of course, and the joy of learning new things. And grandma, if you're
dataset/train/2_105.wav|looking for a much happier, non-destructive video, I'll link our off-road wheelchair project for kids
dataset/train/2_106.wav|that was just released last week. Definitely one of my favorite videos. Like I mentioned at
dataset/train/2_107.wav|the beginning, I do have an extra Kindle Scribe to give away. Just be subscribed and leave any
dataset/train/2_108.wav|comment down below – any comment at all. I'm curious though, when was the last time you sat
dataset/train/2_109.wav|down and read a book. Let me know. And as always thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/20_1.wav|In front of us today we have Xiaomi's new 12S Ultra with a gigantic self proclaimed
dataset/train/20_2.wav|one inch camera sensor inside. The same size of sensor that sits inside of professional cameras.
dataset/train/20_3.wav|If we were to measure the internal sensor by the perimeter, the one inch image taker would
dataset/train/20_4.wav|have the footprint of the square. And if we measured diagonally, like on a TV, a true one
dataset/train/20_5.wav|inch sensor would look a bit more like this. The only way for sure though to see if the sensor is
dataset/train/20_6.wav|actually one inch is to rip the whole thing open and measure from the inside. So let's get started.
dataset/train/20_7.wav|I mean, with the size of the exterior circular camera lens on the back panel, it definitely makes
dataset/train/20_8.wav|you think that the camera might be large. But just like a lifted truck, it also could be an aesthetic
dataset/train/20_9.wav|distraction to conceal what's underneath. Removing the back panel is easy enough. Made from synthetic
dataset/train/20_10.wav|silicone leather to mimic a camera body, it is flexible. After slicing away the adhesive, the
dataset/train/20_11.wav|whole thing can peel up and away from the phone, exposing the triple camera setup underneath.
dataset/train/20_12.wav|All three cameras are protected by that large circle of exterior glass and we can see that
dataset/train/20_13.wav|the main sensor, the important large camera, is off to the left of center. We can also see by
dataset/train/20_14.wav|the physical shape of that main camera housing that Xiaomi probably isn't measuring the sensor
dataset/train/20_15.wav|diagonally. And if Xiaomi is getting that one inch sensor measurement from the sides of the sensor,
dataset/train/20_16.wav|they are being extremely generous with that ruler...but I mean, who hasn't? It's too early
dataset/train/20_17.wav|to say for certain, but I'm starting to think that Xiaomi's one inch sensor isn't exactly one inch.
dataset/train/20_18.wav|Let's go deeper. To get to the battery connections we have to remove 10 Philips head screws on the
dataset/train/20_19.wav|back plastics, as well as detach the flash and light sensor ribbons before the rear plastics
dataset/train/20_20.wav|and 50 watt wireless charging pad can come away from the phone. Below that we have the
dataset/train/20_21.wav|dual battery plugs, conveniently labeled 1 and 2. We can also unsnap the extension ribbons just
dataset/train/20_22.wav|like a little Lego, and make our way down to the seven screws holding down the lower loudspeaker
dataset/train/20_23.wav|and bottom protective plastics. The lower stereo loudspeaker is pretty normal sized. Nothing
dataset/train/20_24.wav|compared to the behemoth that we saw on AGM's recent phone. And, of course, being a flagship,
dataset/train/20_25.wav|we do see little white balls inside which help the speaker sound bigger than it actually is.
dataset/train/20_26.wav|All good things. I can pop off the fingerprint scanning ribbon, the lower ribbon extension,
dataset/train/20_27.wav|remove some signal wire connections, and the lower board can come loose. After which,
dataset/train/20_28.wav|we can join out the USB-C port from the bottom of the phone. This guy is singular, unsoldered,
dataset/train/20_29.wav|easy to replace and provides the internal batteries with 67 watts of juice when plugged in.
dataset/train/20_30.wav|The remaining components in the lower portion of the phone are the waterproofing
dataset/train/20_31.wav|mesh screen over the loudspeaker opening, the square vibrator motor,
dataset/train/20_32.wav|as well as the white water damage indicator sticker next to the SIM card opening.
dataset/train/20_33.wav|The battery is easy enough to remove. No prying or alcohol, just a little tug.
dataset/train/20_34.wav|Samsung could learn a thing or two from Xiaomi about attaching batteries. This guy has a 4,860
dataset/train/20_35.wav|milliamp hour capacity, and has 2 plugs on top for the extra fast charging speeds. Now let's unbury
dataset/train/20_36.wav|the cameras. The motherboard of Xiaomi's 12S Ultra has a few signal wires, a singular screw
dataset/train/20_37.wav|holding down the camera units, and then the whole thing can lift up and out of the phone leaving
dataset/train/20_38.wav|behind the upper loudspeaker and top portion of the vapor chamber for the liquid cooling.
dataset/train/20_39.wav|The rest of the vapor chamber extends down into the battery compartment, giving it enough surface
dataset/train/20_40.wav|area to help dissipate any heat out from the front of the phone through the screen. Removing
dataset/train/20_41.wav|the three camera modules from the motherboard is simple enough. There are three lego-style ribbon
dataset/train/20_42.wav|cables, two on the front of the motherboard, and the third is wrapped around back, pinched down
dataset/train/20_43.wav|underneath the metal bracket. It's interesting back here as well that the processor actually
dataset/train/20_44.wav|has thermal paste and then another copper plate that sits down inside a little square to help with
dataset/train/20_45.wav|the heat dissipation. I don't think we've ever seen a little copper extender unit like this.
dataset/train/20_46.wav|But yeah, it's time to check out that triple camera setup. These three guys are all bound
dataset/train/20_47.wav|securely together. They are inside of a metal housing which keeps all 3 positioned correctly
dataset/train/20_48.wav|and working together as one. We'll bust open that metal housing and free the cameras from
dataset/train/20_49.wav|their captivity. You know, out of the frying pan into the fire. Xiaomi says that this 48 megapixel
dataset/train/20_50.wav|periscope telephoto camera has internal optical image stabilization, and we're going to see what
dataset/train/20_51.wav|that looks like from the inside. The telephoto camera works by moving the actual sensor farther
dataset/train/20_52.wav|away from the camera lens – just like what you would see with sports or nature photography,
dataset/train/20_53.wav|and their really long lenses which magnify the subject to get those close-up shots.
dataset/train/20_54.wav|This is the same concept, just a lot smaller. And it looks like the little copper coils on the
dataset/train/20_55.wav|sides are for that optical image stabilization for both the angled mirror portion and the lens
dataset/train/20_56.wav|portion of that periscope unit – both of which can be manipulated and stabilized from the
dataset/train/20_57.wav|inside with the side mounted electromagnets. The telephoto sensor itself, the part that receives
dataset/train/20_58.wav|the light from the lens and transmits an image to be processed by the smartphone, is mounted
dataset/train/20_59.wav|at the end of the periscope. Finding this little square will give us a good comparison for when we
dataset/train/20_60.wav|dig out the theoretical one inch sensor from the main camera...which should also be pretty easy.
dataset/train/20_61.wav|Now, of course, the camera isn't going to survive this process, but that's never stopped us before.
dataset/train/20_62.wav|With the one inch sensor popped off the back, we do have access to the internal lens elements.
dataset/train/20_63.wav|It looks like both sides of the lens are made with plastic. I'm mostly just curious
dataset/train/20_64.wav|to see what they're made from because I know some photographers have a very
dataset/train/20_65.wav|strong preference for glass on professional camera lenses. But on something this small,
dataset/train/20_66.wav|glass is probably not super feasible. The main camera as well has optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/20_67.wav|Also by using those same copper electromagnetic
dataset/train/20_68.wav|coils that interact with stationary magnets inlaid into the sides of the lens elements.
dataset/train/20_69.wav|All pretty standard. Most smartphones have OIS these days. But now, after tearing this all down,
dataset/train/20_70.wav|we have finally arrived at our destination. Here at what Xiaomi is calling a full one inch sensor,
dataset/train/20_71.wav|which most smartphones do not have. As we can see it is quite a bit larger than the tiny little guy
dataset/train/20_72.wav|we found inside of the periscope camera. A larger sensor generally means it can capture more light
dataset/train/20_73.wav|and theoretically produce a better image. Larger is better. But if we hold it up to
dataset/train/20_74.wav|my dimensionally accurate visual aids here, it is nowhere near one inch in size, neither by height
dataset/train/20_75.wav|nor diagonally, falling far short of the one inch in no matter what direction it's measured.
dataset/train/20_76.wav|Before we grab our pitchforks in riot, however, it turns out when speaking about photography,
dataset/train/20_77.wav|videography, and image sensor sizes, it's not so much about the physical dimensions at all,
dataset/train/20_78.wav|but actually more about the size of a circle that the sensor can fit inside of. Since old cameras
dataset/train/20_79.wav|80 years ago use cylindrical cathode ray tubes, and that circular measurement around the sensor
dataset/train/20_80.wav|is what made sense to measure at the time. So that vernacular has persisted even though the digital
dataset/train/20_81.wav|technology we use now is far different. MKBHD explained this pretty well in one of his videos.
dataset/train/20_82.wav|But while for us the physical size is not actually one inch, in the photography world this is still a
dataset/train/20_83.wav|very normal form of measurement. And Xioami is following those old school photography rules.
dataset/train/20_84.wav|Just like every other camera out there at the moment, it's an antique relic from the olden
dataset/train/20_85.wav|days that just doesn't really make sense anymore, but we still keep it around for some reason. Like,
dataset/train/20_86.wav|you know, the floppy disk icon, fax machines, or members of congress.
dataset/train/20_87.wav|I'm not totally sure that Xiaomi 12S Ultra will still work once we put it all back together since
dataset/train/20_88.wav|we've destroyed parts of it, but it's been very interesting to see how everything is assembled
dataset/train/20_89.wav|from the inside, and learn a bit of history at the same time. Surprisingly the phone does still turn
dataset/train/20_90.wav|on, but since we went from a one inch sensor to a no inch sensor, the 12S Ultra is unable to find
dataset/train/20_91.wav|my cameras. We can tell that they're scattered to bits all over my desk, but we don't need to tell
dataset/train/20_92.wav|the phone that. So while we've discovered that the sensor itself might not be a full physical one
dataset/train/20_93.wav|inch in size, it's still very impressive. But that leaves the question for you, do you think camera
dataset/train/20_94.wav|sensors should be measured differently now that we aren't using the old cathode ray tubes anymore?
dataset/train/20_95.wav|Or should we continue to let the camera industry be overly generous with their rulers? Let me know
dataset/train/20_96.wav|what you think down in the comments below. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. And
dataset/train/20_97.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/21_1.wav|The Xiaomi 12S Ultra has the world's largest smartphone camera in more ways than one.
dataset/train/21_2.wav|Not only does this phone have the current largest physical sensor inside, but also,
dataset/train/21_3.wav|as you can see by the included clear rubber case, this 12S Ultra has the world's largest camera bump
dataset/train/21_4.wav|on the outside. A singular monocle traversing nearly the entire width of the phone.
dataset/train/21_5.wav|It is memorable to be sure, but is Xiaomi's latest design
dataset/train/21_6.wav|durable? That's what we're here to find out. This video is sponsored by Audible. Let's get started.
dataset/train/21_7.wav|On the front side, this 12S Ultra looks just like any other smartphone made within the last 5 years.
dataset/train/21_8.wav|It's only when we get to the backside that things start looking very different. Instead
dataset/train/21_9.wav|of every camera having its own circular lens, we have one giant umbrella of glass covering all
dataset/train/21_10.wav|three cameras at once. And it really is mostly glass back here with no raised metal lips for
dataset/train/21_11.wav|scratch or drop protection, which is a brave move. Let's start with the front.
dataset/train/21_12.wav|As always we have our Mohs scale of hardness which visually tells us what the screen is made from.
dataset/train/21_13.wav|Plastic scratches at a 2 or 3. Normally we see phones rock side to side during this test,
dataset/train/21_14.wav|but with the camera bump the size of the phone, this Xiaomi 12S Ultra rocks top to bottom, and of
dataset/train/21_15.wav|course, comes with an included plastic screen protector. If the screen is made from glass,
dataset/train/21_16.wav|it'll scratch at a 5 or 6. And if it's made from sapphire it'll scratch at an 8 or 9.
dataset/train/21_17.wav|A diamond phone, which we have yet to find, would be a level 10 on Mohs scale of hardness.
dataset/train/21_18.wav|As we see, we do get scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7,
dataset/train/21_19.wav|which means that Xiaomi is using tempered glass in their flagship. That same scratch resistant
dataset/train/21_20.wav|glass is protecting the 32 megapixel hole punch selfie camera. The earpiece slit is super thin
dataset/train/21_21.wav|up here at the top of the phone. Not enough room for a speaker grill. The sides of the
dataset/train/21_22.wav|phone are made from metal, including the rather small power button, and then volume rocker.
dataset/train/21_23.wav|The buttons here are not removable like we have seen on Samsung's phones.
dataset/train/21_24.wav|The top of the phone is actually plastic with no glint of metal underneath the Harman
dataset/train/21_25.wav|Garden branding. Just a microphone, light sensor, and one of the stereo loudspeakers.
dataset/train/21_26.wav|The left side of the phone is rather uneventful,
dataset/train/21_27.wav|just more metal. Down at the bottom we have our second loudspeaker, 67 watt fast charging USB-C
dataset/train/21_28.wav|port, and our dual SIM card tray with an orange rubber waterproofing ring to help with the IP68
dataset/train/21_29.wav|water resistance. So far, all pretty standard for a smartphone. Making our way to the back panel.
dataset/train/21_30.wav|Xiaomi has their logo reflectively and securely inlaid into the self-proclaimed, environmentally
dataset/train/21_31.wav|friendly, silicone leather back panel. There is a 50 watt wireless charger in here somewhere.
dataset/train/21_32.wav|And while I mean, Xiaomi is technically correct that silicone is slightly environmentally better
dataset/train/21_33.wav|than plastic, let's not kid ourselves about any of this actually being good for the environment.
dataset/train/21_34.wav|Planned obsolescent e-waste does not suddenly become clean just because a cow didn't die.
dataset/train/21_35.wav|Where was I? Oh yeah, the camera lens. Tucked up inside the beach ball sized camera bump
dataset/train/21_36.wav|are three separate cameras all protected by one giant thick slab
dataset/train/21_37.wav|of glass – like a big contact lens. Or, you know, Mike Wazowski's face.
dataset/train/21_38.wav|Speaking of aliens and lenses though, I learned recently that when the Hubble telescope was
dataset/train/21_39.wav|launched into space way back in 1990, it was actually near instantly unusable because the
dataset/train/21_40.wav|large, almost 8 foot mirror that collected light had been accidentally ground down to the wrong
dataset/train/21_41.wav|shape and was producing very blurry images. It was an error of astronomical proportions. I
dataset/train/21_42.wav|learned about this mistake while listening to the audiobook “Handprints on Hubble” from my
dataset/train/21_43.wav|channel's sponsor, Audible, written by Katherine Sullivan, the first woman to walk in space.
dataset/train/21_44.wav|The audiobook details how NASA was able to fix the telescope with astronauts while it was still in
dataset/train/21_45.wav|orbit, since Hubble was designed to be modular, repairable, and upgradable from the get go,
dataset/train/21_46.wav|which is pretty cool. That modularity is one of the reasons why Hubble is still functioning today,
dataset/train/21_47.wav|taking awesome images 30 years after its launch. If you want to listen to “Handprints on Hubble,”
dataset/train/21_48.wav|new members can try Audible for free for 30 days, with the link down in the description.
dataset/train/21_49.wav|Audible.com/jerryrig. Audible comes with a huge selection of audiobooks of course,
dataset/train/21_50.wav|but also Audible Originals, and podcasts across every genre. Even guided fitness programs. And,
dataset/train/21_51.wav|of course, you'll get to choose a new title to add to your library every month.
dataset/train/21_52.wav|Personally, I kind of like the more technical documentary style audiobooks, but man, they do
dataset/train/21_53.wav|have everything. If you want to learn how Hubble was safe from being a two billion dollar orbiting
dataset/train/21_54.wav|pile of junk, that “Handprints on Hubble” link is down in the description. Audible.com/jerryrig or
dataset/train/21_55.wav|text the word “JerryRig” to 500-500. And you can start listening from anywhere, anytime.
dataset/train/21_56.wav|Now, luckily the lens atop Xiaomi's 12S Ultra doesn't need to be optically precise
dataset/train/21_57.wav|since it's here mostly for protection and not necessarily for any photographic precision.
dataset/train/21_58.wav|The bottom camera is the 45 megapixel telephoto. The center camera is the 48
dataset/train/21_59.wav|megapixel wide angle lens. And the main camera, the one with the one inch massive sensor,
dataset/train/21_60.wav|surprisingly is the one off to the side and not the one front and center.
dataset/train/21_61.wav|We'll dig more into that from the inside during the teardown. Since the singular lens is made
dataset/train/21_62.wav|from glass though, I'm already looking forward to all the cracked camera backs we're about to see.
dataset/train/21_63.wav|Make sure to tag me on Twitter if yours ends up breaking
dataset/train/21_64.wav|so we can all supportively, of course, join in your misery. There is, of course,
dataset/train/21_65.wav|an optical underscreen fingerprint scanner. Pretty standard on smartphones these days,
dataset/train/21_66.wav|but it also doesn't seem to be working all that great registering my fingerprint.
dataset/train/21_67.wav|Now, my fingerprints probably aren't the best candidates though. After working on all kinds
dataset/train/21_68.wav|of projects, the surfaces of my fingers aren't photogenic enough to function properly with a lot
dataset/train/21_69.wav|of these scanners. Either way, I don't use them very often, and I'm also not too worried about it.
dataset/train/21_70.wav|Xiaomi has pulled out all the stops with their display though. With 1440 pics, 1500 nits,
dataset/train/21_71.wav|10 bits, and 120 hz, it's what we would expect in a flagship. And, of course, all 6.7 inches
dataset/train/21_72.wav|lasted about 30 seconds under the heat from my lighter before going white and not recovering,
dataset/train/21_73.wav|which means it's AMOLED. Now for the bend test. A camera lens that spans the whole
dataset/train/21_74.wav|back panel might just be a weak point. Xiaomi hasn't always survived my tests, intentionally
dataset/train/21_75.wav|dividing a phone in half might just provide the hypothetical dotted line it needs to snap along.
dataset/train/21_76.wav|And while there was a significant bop, there doesn't appear to be any catastrophic damage
dataset/train/21_77.wav|like we saw in the OnePlus 10. This Xiaomi 12S Ultra does sure flex quite a bit, but the camera
dataset/train/21_78.wav|lens itself remains intact and the phone is still functional. Turns out that pop we encountered
dataset/train/21_79.wav|was a subluxation of the upper perimeter with propinquity to the antenna line. A weak spot
dataset/train/21_80.wav|we have seen on other smartphones, but without catastrophic results in this particular case.
dataset/train/21_81.wav|Even with this newly minted minor physical flaw, the phone does live on and still functions, which
dataset/train/21_82.wav|means the Xiaomi 12S Ultra passes my durability test. Nice work, Xiaomi. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/21_83.wav|The design of this 12S Ultra is definitely outside the box, memorable, and now we know,
dataset/train/21_84.wav|mostly durable. Let me know a phone you want to see tested next down in the comments.
dataset/train/21_85.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Grab your free audiobook with
dataset/train/21_86.wav|a link in the description. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/22_1.wav|Today we're going to take a look, quite literally, at the 3rd Generation under
dataset/train/22_2.wav|display camera on the Axon 40 Ultra. We'll see how this 3rd Generation holds up and if
dataset/train/22_3.wav|anything has improved from last year. For reference, here's a clip from last year's Axon
dataset/train/22_4.wav|30 with its 2nd Generation under display camera. You'll have to let me know down in the comments
dataset/train/22_5.wav|which one you think is better, or if anything improved. While you're analyzing the quality,
dataset/train/22_6.wav|huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. I'm a huge fan of saving time and money,
dataset/train/22_7.wav|so when I started shipping my JerryRigEverything Knives, I knew that Stamps.com could get me
dataset/train/22_8.wav|discounts not found anywhere else. Like 30% off USPS and 86% off UPS. Dang, that knife is
dataset/train/22_9.wav|shiny. And I can get those discounted shipping rates right here from home with my own computer
dataset/train/22_10.wav|and my regular old printer, no special equipment needed. I was up and running in minutes with
dataset/train/22_11.wav|Stamps.com printing any postage for any size package, sending anywhere in the world. We've
dataset/train/22_12.wav|sent these knives to every single continent on the planet so far, except for Antarctica. I guess
dataset/train/22_13.wav|penguins don't have good wi-fi. But it is nice to know that if the penguins ever did need a razor,
dataset/train/22_14.wav|I wouldn't even have to leave my house to ship it. It's really nice not having to stand in line at
dataset/train/22_15.wav|the post office. Stamps.com integrates seamlessly with Shopify, Amazon, Etsy, Ebay, and a whole lot
dataset/train/22_16.wav|of other online storefronts. So whether you're an office sending out invoices, an Etsy shop sending
dataset/train/22_17.wav|out products, or a large warehouse shipping out orders on the daily, Stamps.com is a complete
dataset/train/22_18.wav|mailing and shipping solution. To sweeten the deal, if you go to Stamps.com/JerryRig you get
dataset/train/22_19.wav|a free 4-week trial, free postage, and a free digital scale. Stamps.com/JerryRig.
dataset/train/22_20.wav|And of course I will be keeping you updated on the razor knife penguin situation down in Antarctica.
dataset/train/22_21.wav|Now it's time to take a slightly more aggressive look
dataset/train/22_22.wav|at this under display camera. Let's get started.
dataset/train/22_23.wav|ZTE has been hiding under screen cameras in their phones for about 3 years now,
dataset/train/22_24.wav|each version getting slightly better than the previous version...kinda.
dataset/train/22_25.wav|Inside the box we do get a full suite of accessories,
dataset/train/22_26.wav|a clear protective case, USB-C cable, and a 65 watt fast charging brick,
dataset/train/22_27.wav|along with a set of headphones that happen to have a headphone jack for a phone with no headphone
dataset/train/22_28.wav|jack. Some companies include less adapters in the box, but ZTE is here throwing them all in. As far
dataset/train/22_29.wav|as the front camera goes, there is no hole punch and no notch. There's also no secondary patch
dataset/train/22_30.wav|of screen that used to be there camouflaging the previous generations. This time around it appears
dataset/train/22_31.wav|to be one panel of densely packed pixels, and very much invisible. When held at the very perfect
dataset/train/22_32.wav|angle with perfect lighting, I can make out a small circle under the pixels, which is similar
dataset/train/22_33.wav|to what an optical underscreen fingerprint scanner would look like. If you take a look at the Axon 20
dataset/train/22_34.wav|from 2 years ago you can see how much improvement has been made with this concealment. We're moving
dataset/train/22_35.wav|along pretty well, but what about image quality when compared to a regular selfie camera? Since
dataset/train/22_36.wav|the camera under the glass is looking through the equivalent of a very dirty window even when
dataset/train/22_37.wav|the pixels above it are turned off. The Axon 40 has to use some algorithms to clear up the image.
dataset/train/22_38.wav|This leaves us with a very soft, almost beauty filter looking picture. Especially when we compare
dataset/train/22_39.wav|it to my nearly 3 year old Note 10 Plus that's still my daily driver. I look like myself on
dataset/train/22_40.wav|my own phone, but with the other camera I kind of look like that one girl we all know on Instagram.
dataset/train/22_41.wav|ZTE has the hiding part of the underscreen camera nailed to perfection.
dataset/train/22_42.wav|It's the camera part of the camera that still needs some tweaking. I wonder if we put a higher
dataset/train/22_43.wav|megapixel camera underneath the screen if it would give more detail for the algorithm to work with.
dataset/train/22_44.wav|Or maybe if we add two cameras with dissimilar pixel patterns over the top
dataset/train/22_45.wav|so a single good image can be obtained after both images are combined. Or, you know, since I'm on a
dataset/train/22_46.wav|roll here, ZTE could include a single camera with OIS that can optically shift slightly,
dataset/train/22_47.wav|taking two pictures between pixels to get even more information for a single good image.
dataset/train/22_48.wav|All suggestions from a guy with no experience in taking pictures under a display.
dataset/train/22_49.wav|Either way though, I am impressed with the invisibility. It also scratches at level 6,
dataset/train/22_50.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7. It's kind of mind blowing. I'm zoomed in about 200%
dataset/train/22_51.wav|resolution with a 4K studio camera, and there's still no indications of any 16 megapixel cameras
dataset/train/22_52.wav|underneath the earpiece slit. Realistically, to the naked eye it is invisible. Nice work, ZTE.
dataset/train/22_53.wav|The sides of the Axon 40 are made from metal.
dataset/train/22_54.wav|Rather, thin slices of metal, with how much glass is waterfalling around both sides.
dataset/train/22_55.wav|The power button and volume rocker are also both made from metal.
dataset/train/22_56.wav|Up at the top of the phone we have more metal and what looks like an IR blaster.
dataset/train/22_57.wav|Kind of cool. On the right side we have a whole lot more metal and a few antenna lines. On the
dataset/train/22_58.wav|bottom we have our 65 watt USB-C port that keeps our 5,000 milliamp hour all juiced up,
dataset/train/22_59.wav|along with a dual SIM card tray, but no expandable storage. ZTE did put the microphone hole down here
dataset/train/22_60.wav|next to the SIM card hole, which will probably sketch out a few people who accidentally put
dataset/train/22_61.wav|it in the wrong hole. No worries though, I did make a whole video about the holes
dataset/train/22_62.wav|and why it's not an issue. I'll link that down in the description.
dataset/train/22_63.wav|The back of the phone is pretty interesting. The Axon 40 Ultra
dataset/train/22_64.wav|is taking the soft touched etched glass to another level,
dataset/train/22_65.wav|going past soft straight into more of a textured glass with some major glitter.
dataset/train/22_66.wav|Getting all up close and personal you can see the texture with your own eyes.
dataset/train/22_67.wav|I'm definitely not complaining, I think it's actually pretty cool. Personally, I always have
dataset/train/22_68.wav|a case on my phone so it wouldn't matter much to me either way. But I am down with the uniqueness.
dataset/train/22_69.wav|We have 3 massive cameras on the back, all of which are 64 megapixels. The wide angle up top,
dataset/train/22_70.wav|the main camera in the center, and a telephoto camera down at the bottom,
dataset/train/22_71.wav|all tucked inside the pretty large rectangular glass camera bump.
dataset/train/22_72.wav|The Axon 40 Ultra is ZTE's flagship at the moment, sitting right around $800. And yeah,
dataset/train/22_73.wav|while it's under display camera might get the phone noticed, the display on top of the camera
dataset/train/22_74.wav|can also hold its own. Pretty large at 6.8 inches. It's got a 120 hertz refresh rate,
dataset/train/22_75.wav|1500 nits of brightness, and a 10 bit color depth with 1 billion different color combinations. And,
dataset/train/22_76.wav|of course, since you're curious, it lasted for about 23 seconds on the burn test
dataset/train/22_77.wav|before going white. The pixels do mostly recover though.
dataset/train/22_78.wav|The selfie camera isn't the only thing hiding under the glass.
dataset/train/22_79.wav|The optical fingerprint scanner is also under the slab and underneath the pixels. After setting my
dataset/train/22_80.wav|fingerprint and adding level 7 deeper grooves, more than it would ever realistically see in life,
dataset/train/22_81.wav|it's still able to read my fingerprint every time. Thumbs up for that. Finally though, we come to the
dataset/train/22_82.wav|bend test. It's the final trial of durability that most phones do survive. I think the only phone to
dataset/train/22_83.wav|break in half this year so far is the OnePlus 10 Pro, but I'm always down to add another to
dataset/train/22_84.wav|the list. Lucky for this Axon though, when bent from the back it did feel a little squishy for a
dataset/train/22_85.wav|split second but then locked out. When bent from the front there was a little pop but nothing out
dataset/train/22_86.wav|of the ordinary and nothing catastrophic. The Axon 40 Ultra is another solid phone from ZTE.
dataset/train/22_87.wav|I think the under display selfie thing is kind of cool. Personally I'm looking forward to seeing
dataset/train/22_88.wav|how the Axon lineup can clean things up a bit more for next year. I'm curious though, does the
dataset/train/22_89.wav|image softness bother you at all? Do you think this front facing camera is currently usable?
dataset/train/22_90.wav|Let me know down in the comments. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/22_91.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/23_1.wav|Welcome back to my desk. Today we're going to be taking apart the brand new
dataset/train/23_2.wav|Steam- Deck - the mobile gaming system. If you remember from my durability test video I am giving
dataset/train/23_3.wav|one of these away. Sold out everywhere, the one we are giving away is brand new, pristine....although
dataset/train/23_4.wav|if you'd like me to rough it up a bit before I send it over, I'm sure we can arrange something.
dataset/train/23_5.wav|And like always, after picking the winner of the giveaway I will be buying the shipping
dataset/train/23_6.wav|with Stamps.com. Huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. I've been using Stamps.com
dataset/train/23_7.wav|for the last few years to ship everything, whether it's my JerryRigEverything Knives, t-shirts,
dataset/train/23_8.wav|or stuff for the winners of giveaways, Stamps.com makes it quick and easy. But most importantly,
dataset/train/23_9.wav|they save me money. And when they save me money it really means they save you money because I
dataset/train/23_10.wav|can pass those savings down to the people who buy my stuff. It's important, especially these days
dataset/train/23_11.wav|when every penny counts. For more than 20 years Stamps.com has been giving massive discounts - up
dataset/train/23_12.wav|to 30% off USPS and up to 86% off UPS. It's awesome that I can get all of those savings
dataset/train/23_13.wav|without even leaving my computer. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like going outside,
dataset/train/23_14.wav|but why stand in line at the post office when you can just not. If you have an online business,
dataset/train/23_15.wav|Stamps.com integrates seamlessly with Shopify, Etsy, Amazon, Ebay, and other online storefronts.
dataset/train/23_16.wav|All you need is a regular computer and a regular printer and you're up and running in minutes,
dataset/train/23_17.wav|printing official postage for any letter, any size package, anywhere you want to
dataset/train/23_18.wav|send it. If you want to keep money in your pocket, just head to Stamps.com/JerryRig
dataset/train/23_19.wav|to get a free trial, free postage, and a free 5 pound digital scale. And like always, no long term
dataset/train/23_20.wav|commitments or contracts, just how we like it. Stamps.com/JerryRig. And of course I'll get right
dataset/train/23_21.wav|back to shipping my knives and stuff as soon as we finish with this teardown. Let's get started.
dataset/train/23_22.wav|The Steam Deck is a hand held portable device that lets you carry around your computer games in one
dataset/train/23_23.wav|convenient location. It's like a slightly nerdier version of the Nintendo Switch.
dataset/train/23_24.wav|No detachable controllers though, it's all one solid unit. I'll leave the gaming and software
dataset/train/23_25.wav|analysis to other reviewers though. Today we're going to take it apart and see how it's all
dataset/train/23_26.wav|put together. It's actually surprisingly easy, with just 8 screws around the back.
dataset/train/23_27.wav|Four large black Phillips head screws around the edges, and four smaller screws in the center.
dataset/train/23_28.wav|The screws are self tapping and screwed into plastic.
dataset/train/23_29.wav|Steam has said that once it's open it'll never quite be the same again since the screws will
dataset/train/23_30.wav|rethread themselves as it's assembled. Not too big of a deal, just something to keep in mind.
dataset/train/23_31.wav|After the screws are gone I can take my plastic pry tool and pop the clasps around the edges,
dataset/train/23_32.wav|and the whole thing is open. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/23_33.wav|There's a lot to take in back here but the first thing we can look at is the metal grill
dataset/train/23_34.wav|that's attached to the rear panel for the fan intake. It's kind of plastic riveted in place.
dataset/train/23_35.wav|And surprisingly it's made from little hexagons, just like my JerryRig Razor Knife, link in the
dataset/train/23_36.wav|description. Back here, as well, we have the 4 programmable buttons attached inside the grips.
dataset/train/23_37.wav|These are just little flippy boys that flex inward ever so slightly when pressed,
dataset/train/23_38.wav|then come in contact with the button that's attached to the motherboard. Interesting that
dataset/train/23_39.wav|the two visible circuit boards have a large R and L on them to help keep things organized.
dataset/train/23_40.wav|I'm a fan of that. There's so much going on in here. Just like the Nintendo Switch we do have
dataset/train/23_41.wav|a large fan inside. And just like the Nintendo Switch we also have a large battery inside.
dataset/train/23_42.wav|Although instead of the 4,000 milliamp hours, this Steam Deck has 5,000. But more on that later.
dataset/train/23_43.wav|Let's check out the cooling system. The black sticker on the bottom is purely aesthetic. It's
dataset/train/23_44.wav|what you see underneath the fan intake grill. It runs from that intake along the top of the metal
dataset/train/23_45.wav|plate, into the fan, and then gets shot out the top of the device. The metal plate is probably
dataset/train/23_46.wav|here so that metal dust doesn't accumulate on top of the motherboard circuits. But how does
dataset/train/23_47.wav|that airflow aid in the cooling? Removing three more black Phillips head screws we can see that
dataset/train/23_48.wav|there are some rather juicy looking thermal foam pads resting on top of the components that need
dataset/train/23_49.wav|focused cooling. Kind of like thermal paste on a processor, except for different. The smooshy
dataset/train/23_50.wav|bits might look like angel food cake, but I can assure you they do not taste like angel food cake.
dataset/train/23_51.wav|The fan isn't necessarily drawing air in through any specific channel or conduit, like we saw on
dataset/train/23_52.wav|the Legion Dual 2, may it rest in peace. Instead this Steam Deck just kind of pulls air in from all
dataset/train/23_53.wav|over the deck and shoots it out the top...like a PC case with a single large fan in the back.
dataset/train/23_54.wav|With the battery unplugged we can take out another screw over the internal SSD.
dataset/train/23_55.wav|It's super easy to remove, just like we would see inside of a laptop,
dataset/train/23_56.wav|except for that this time it's wearing a fancy little silver dress. Styling for
dataset/train/23_57.wav|sure. Apparently the dress is to help keep the drive isolated from the rest of the circuits so
dataset/train/23_58.wav|that it doesn't receive or create any electronic interference. Not sure if these are swappable yet,
dataset/train/23_59.wav|but with iFixit being responsible for all the Steam Deck replacement parts,
dataset/train/23_60.wav|due later this summer, we should find out more about compatibility soon enough. Fun fact:
dataset/train/23_61.wav|as I'm uploading this video, it looks like iFixit has uploaded some parts on their websites.
dataset/train/23_62.wav|Replacement screens are around $60, rear plastic housings are $25, fans $25, and the thumbstick
dataset/train/23_63.wav|is $20. There are no motherboards or SSDs yet, but it would be cool at some point if you could
dataset/train/23_64.wav|build your own Steam Deck right from iFixit's website. As soon as they become available I might
dataset/train/23_65.wav|just try it. Super cool of Valve to preemptively allow repairs though. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/23_66.wav|Speaking of thumbs, the next out are the dual thumbsticks on either side of the deck.
dataset/train/23_67.wav|If the Nintendo Switch taught us anything it's that the joysticks are probably going
dataset/train/23_68.wav|to be the first component that bites the dust. My own Switch ended up drifting on
dataset/train/23_69.wav|both joycons after just a few years. So it's nice that these can be replaced within minutes.
dataset/train/23_70.wav|The red wire running through the top is for the capacitive plate on the upper side of the thumb
dataset/train/23_71.wav|stick. The left joystick is a mirrored image of the right joystick and have their corresponding
dataset/train/23_72.wav|R's and L's on the board to keep them organized. Next up, we have more of the cooling system,
dataset/train/23_73.wav|a large copper heatpipe that rests on the main processor, and takes advantage of all
dataset/train/23_74.wav|that airflow leaving the Steam Deck next to the fan. There's a bunch of thin slivers of copper
dataset/train/23_75.wav|that act as a radiator that help keep the vapor in that chamber cool, and the main processor at
dataset/train/23_76.wav|a reasonable temperature. I guess this is where the Deck lets off its steam. Buh-dum-ching.
dataset/train/23_77.wav|The next thing I want to take a look at is the large square touchpad
dataset/train/23_78.wav|which should be hiding somewhere underneath this daughterboard. We can undo a few more
dataset/train/23_79.wav|screws and unclip the right trigger, which has yet another screw hiding underneath. The spring
dataset/train/23_80.wav|is the part that keeps the trigger springy. With the trigger gone we can start unlatching ribbons.
dataset/train/23_81.wav|Ribbons are what join all the different boards together. There are no Lego-style connectors.
dataset/train/23_82.wav|Remember there is also no IP rating or water protection on this thing,
dataset/train/23_83.wav|so keeping it away from water is very important. The daughterboard is rather uneventful, but what
dataset/train/23_84.wav|lies beneath is rather extraordinary. The trackpad is resting on its own string suspension system.
dataset/train/23_85.wav|The springs keep the gold portion of the track pad positioned just above the board of the track pad.
dataset/train/23_86.wav|And the serpent of wires on the board help relay where your finger is positioned as it's scrolling.
dataset/train/23_87.wav|You can see how it flexes when I'm pushing up against it from the outside.
dataset/train/23_88.wav|I do, however, want to go deeper. So I'll unscrew the springy bits which allows us to
dataset/train/23_89.wav|pull the track pad out completely, away from the Steam Deck body. Pretty slick little component.
dataset/train/23_90.wav|You'll notice that there is a red and black wire leaving from the trackpad, and that's because
dataset/train/23_91.wav|there's something special inside. I thought the entrance might be under the gold portion,
dataset/train/23_92.wav|but it's definitely not. Fingers crossed that this still works when I put it back together.
dataset/train/23_93.wav|The entrance is actually located on the top portion of the track pad, which can unsnap
dataset/train/23_94.wav|and separate, revealing that the red and black wires lead to another circuit board that's inside,
dataset/train/23_95.wav|running an internal vibrator for the instant haptic feedback. Each of the track pads has its
dataset/train/23_96.wav|own motor. And once again, cute little R inside in case you sneeze and all your parts get mixed up
dataset/train/23_97.wav|while you're working on it. Speaking of which, I'll get this trackpad put back in place before
dataset/train/23_98.wav|I forget how it's all situated. Up in the top corner we have our visually awkward looking
dataset/train/23_99.wav|but cosmetically comfortable action buttons. This side is the XYAB buttons and they work by having a
dataset/train/23_100.wav|conductive surface on the board that activates when a portion of a conductive piece of rubber
dataset/train/23_101.wav|comes in contact with it. Very similar to the Nintendo Switch and handheld controllers since the
dataset/train/23_102.wav|dawn of time, including the old school Nintendo controllers that did this as well. The exterior
dataset/train/23_103.wav|plastic button sits on the rubber and when pressed, the contact pad on the bottom touches
dataset/train/23_104.wav|the board allowing you to vanquish all your enemies, or plant trees in farmville. I don't know
dataset/train/23_105.wav|what games bring you joy. It's nice that rubber basically has infinite flex and probably won't
dataset/train/23_106.wav|ever wear out within the lifespan of the Deck. Each of the plastic buttons also only goes in
dataset/train/23_107.wav|one position, so it's impossible to mix up their locations, or for the letters to be upside down.
dataset/train/23_108.wav|Valve is doing us a favor by allowing repairs and also minimizing the ways it can be assembled
dataset/train/23_109.wav|incorrectly. Very much appreciated. And we haven't even gotten to the motherboard yet. It's got a few
dataset/train/23_110.wav|screws of its own, some signal wires, and for some complicated reason, two more ribbon cables plugged
dataset/train/23_111.wav|into the backside. On a device that's easy to take apart, this is a strange move. But there you have
dataset/train/23_112.wav|it. The mainboard in all its chippy glory. There is a black protective plastic layer on the back.
dataset/train/23_113.wav|That's probably because underneath the motherboard is a metal subframe,
dataset/train/23_114.wav|which probably also held with the structural portion of the bend test. We can see the ribbon
dataset/train/23_115.wav|from the screen popping up behind the board. We also have an inside look at the headphone
dataset/train/23_116.wav|jack and buttons for the volume adjustments. They have their own board as well. Finally, the massive
dataset/train/23_117.wav|battery. About 1,000 milliamps larger than the Nintendo Switch, it's a pretty big boy. The only
dataset/train/23_118.wav|downside is that just like the Nintendo Switch, there is a ton of glue holding it in place. I
dataset/train/23_119.wav|could probably use a bunch of heat or drip some isopropyl alcohol behind to dissolve the adhesive,
dataset/train/23_120.wav|but I don't feel like exploding today. And I also want this thing to keep working when it's put back
dataset/train/23_121.wav|together. Aggressively handled and bent batteries don't end up lasting for very long afterwards.
dataset/train/23_122.wav|So we'll just politely ask Valve for some magic pull tabs on the Steam Deck too.
dataset/train/23_123.wav|And of course, we have the centrally positioned fan.
dataset/train/23_124.wav|Overall I'm pretty impressed. While my personal gaming skills probably peaked with Pokemon Blue
dataset/train/23_125.wav|on the GameBoy Color, I can appreciate the epic leap this Steam Deck makes with mobile gaming.
dataset/train/23_126.wav|Rumor has it that Age of Empires might also be playable on the Deck.
dataset/train/23_127.wav|Let me know what your favorite game is and maybe I'll give it a shot.
dataset/train/23_128.wav|With all the self tapping screws back in place on the back panel,
dataset/train/23_129.wav|I can plug it in and it looks like we might just be successful. Quite honestly though,
dataset/train/23_130.wav|if you want to save yourself the hassle of taking apart your own Steam Deck,
dataset/train/23_131.wav|but still want to see all the epicness inside, my Teardown Skin for this console is probably
dataset/train/23_132.wav|one of the coolest ones we've ever made. With the vibrators visible underneath the touchpads,
dataset/train/23_133.wav|and the fan, battery, and all boards laid out with their L's and R's, no Steam Deck would be complete
dataset/train/23_134.wav|without it in my opinion. I'll leave my dbrand link down in the video description so you can
dataset/train/23_135.wav|grab one for yourself. And as far as functionality goes, it looks like everything is still working.
dataset/train/23_136.wav|Joysticks, action buttons, and even both trackpads. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/23_137.wav|Let me know what your current favorite game is down in the comments.
dataset/train/23_138.wav|Since this works I'll be looking for some new ones. Come hang out with me
dataset/train/23_139.wav|on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/24_1.wav|The Steam Deck. Full disclosure, I am not a gamer. I played Age of Empires all growing up, dabbled
dataset/train/24_2.wav|with Halo at friends' houses in high school, and played through Breath of the Wild twice. And while
dataset/train/24_3.wav|I might not play a whole lot of video games, I can still appreciate solid hardware. Today we're
dataset/train/24_4.wav|going to durability test the all new Steam Deck portable gaming system. This guy starts at $399,
dataset/train/24_5.wav|which sounds like a pretty good deal. Pretty similar to the Nintendo Switch. Today we'll be
dataset/train/24_6.wav|testing the top of the line $650 version that has the premium anti-glare etched glass screen.
dataset/train/24_7.wav|And we will indeed by finding out whatever it is that actually means. Let's get started.
dataset/train/24_8.wav|It's interesting to see what's going on here with the Steam Deck. Steam
dataset/train/24_9.wav|is a video game distribution service that has almost 20 years worth of downloadable
dataset/train/24_10.wav|games...almost 30,000 titles, most of which are made for computers.
dataset/train/24_11.wav|Two thousand of those titles so far are currently playable on this portable Steam Deck. I'm pretty
dataset/train/24_12.wav|sure though that nobody has played with their deck in the same way I'm about to play with mine.
dataset/train/24_13.wav|The biggest difference between the cheapest Steam Deck and the most expensive, besides the
dataset/train/24_14.wav|memory size, is this new etched anti-reflective glass surface. You might be like, 'Hey Jerry,
dataset/train/24_15.wav|why do you have two sold out Steam Decks when I can't even get one?' And the answer to that
dataset/train/24_16.wav|is maybe one of these is yours...but more on that later. The etched glass supposedly breaks up and
dataset/train/24_17.wav|gently disperses any light shining at it so it's not bounced or reflected back onto the viewer.
dataset/train/24_18.wav|Kind of like those colored plastic things in urinals, except for dispersing sunlight they're
dataset/train/24_19.wav|dispersing... (clears throat). What really matters though is that the frosted glass, in theory,
dataset/train/24_20.wav|allows us to better focus more on what's underneath than what's reflecting from above
dataset/train/24_21.wav|or outside. Personally though, I'm not overly sold on the anti-glare stuff. As you can see my
dataset/train/24_22.wav|desk is more lit up than SpaceX on launch day. And the screen of the Steam Deck is barely visible.
dataset/train/24_23.wav|Adding a few more nits of brightness would have been more effective than the anti-glare.
dataset/train/24_24.wav|The etching also makes things awkward with the scratch test since the ever so slightly
dataset/train/24_25.wav|roughed up level 6 glass is now acting like sandpaper to my Mohs hardness picks.
dataset/train/24_26.wav|And as you can see we are leaving marks from 2, all the way up the scale. The actual damage of
dataset/train/24_27.wav|course only occurs with the scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at level 7. But the markings
dataset/train/24_28.wav|left behind by the other picks aren't rubbing off on their own either. The less expensive Steam
dataset/train/24_29.wav|Decks are made with just smooth glass and won't have this abrasive issue. All of the Steam Decks
dataset/train/24_30.wav|though are made with glass screens, and as we know, glass is glass, and glass needs protection.
dataset/train/24_31.wav|Luckily my channel sponsor dbrand is doing their thing with precision fit slices of optically clear
dataset/train/24_32.wav|protective tempered glass screen protectors. You might have read online that some of the
dataset/train/24_33.wav|lower quality Steam Deck screen protectors are hampering the touch sensitivity of the display,
dataset/train/24_34.wav|but that's not the case with dbrand's premium glass. It's designed to be ultra thin
dataset/train/24_35.wav|like it's not even there. The screen is still dark of course. I do have my brightness all the way up,
dataset/train/24_36.wav|but at least the console is protected against scratches and impacts. I'll leave a link down
dataset/train/24_37.wav|in the description so you can grab one for your own deck or for your smartphone.
dataset/train/24_38.wav|Speaking of scratches though, let's see what this deck is made with.
dataset/train/24_39.wav|Starting on the right side we get a whole lot of plastic. The menu button is plastic and even these
dataset/train/24_40.wav|little glossy A B X Y keys on the top right corner are made from plastic. Interesting though, just
dataset/train/24_41.wav|like we saw on the Nintendo Switch, the lettering is inlaid all the way through the buttons.
dataset/train/24_42.wav|I can shave off entire slices of the letters like a birthday cake and the font is still there,
dataset/train/24_43.wav|cooked all the way through the button. It would be impossible for your thumbs to wear off these
dataset/train/24_44.wav|letters even after years of gaming. Thumbs up for that. The decals on the other buttons
dataset/train/24_45.wav|though do just kind of scrape off. The thumb stick has a plasticy capacitive surface on top
dataset/train/24_46.wav|with rubber grippy halo things around the edges. It doesn't feel like it will fall
dataset/train/24_47.wav|apart on its own. Same kind of vibe goes for the large square trackpad.
dataset/train/24_48.wav|Scratchable but has a cool feeling vibrator underneath.
dataset/train/24_49.wav|It'll be fun to see what this looks like from the inside when we take it apart.
dataset/train/24_50.wav|The top of the Steam Deck has more plastic, along with the plastic power button,
dataset/train/24_51.wav|45 watt USB-C port, fan vent, headphone jack, and plastic volume buttons. No metal so far.
dataset/train/24_52.wav|The left side of the console is very symmetrical to the right side with more plastic.
dataset/train/24_53.wav|The Steam button lettering does scrape off pretty easily. And, of course,
dataset/train/24_54.wav|we have the glossy d-pad over here in the corner. Still plastic. Along with the plastic triggers.
dataset/train/24_55.wav|There is a metal fan intake grill, surprisingly.
dataset/train/24_56.wav|And then 4 additional programmable plastic buttons on the back.
dataset/train/24_57.wav|The only metal on this whole thing is that grill for the fan.
dataset/train/24_58.wav|You might have noticed a large Valve sign on the back.
dataset/train/24_59.wav|This is actually an Art Class with Jerry request by the Steam Deck designers,
dataset/train/24_60.wav|which I assume is for me to talk about my favorite fixed geometry valvular conduit,
dataset/train/24_61.wav|which is the Tesla valve invented by none other than Nikola Tesla himself. It's a pretty sweet
dataset/train/24_62.wav|little contraption with no moving parts that allows liquid to flow through one direction. But
dataset/train/24_63.wav|if the flow were to reverse, all these little side channels, enlargements, and turbulent recesses
dataset/train/24_64.wav|would make upstream flow much more difficult. So if I had to pick a favorite valve, it would be
dataset/train/24_65.wav|this one. Thanks for the drawing suggestion Steam Deck design team, wherever you are.
dataset/train/24_66.wav|The bottom of the Deck does have a micro SD slot which allows for an additional terabyte
dataset/train/24_67.wav|of video game storage. Pretty cool. And as you can tell with all the air vents and no
dataset/train/24_68.wav|flap over the SD card, there is also no water resistance to water, or dare I say it, steam.
dataset/train/24_69.wav|Personally, I think it's super smart of the Steam people to get into the mobile space.
dataset/train/24_70.wav|The Nintendo Switch has sold over 100 million units, and the PSP sold around
dataset/train/24_71.wav|80 million. So even if Steam captured even a tiny percentage of the mobile gamers,
dataset/train/24_72.wav|it would be a worthwhile venture. The Steam Deck is very similar in size to the Nintendo Switch,
dataset/train/24_73.wav|with a 7 inch display and a 60 hertz refresh rate. We can tell it's an IPS LCD by the way it
dataset/train/24_74.wav|goes black after about 20 seconds under the heat from my lighter...well blacker than it normally is
dataset/train/24_75.wav|I guess. We really should have picked a brighter game because 400 nits of brightness is just not
dataset/train/24_76.wav|super great. For reference, the iPhone 13 Pro has 1000 nits, and the Samsung S22 Ultra has 1300.
dataset/train/24_77.wav|Outdoor gaming just isn't going to be super realistic with this guy,
dataset/train/24_78.wav|but I don't think any of us were planning on going outside anyway though so it's fine.
dataset/train/24_79.wav|Finally, the bend test. I will do my best to try and detach these permanently attached controls.
dataset/train/24_80.wav|I am a little nervous since this thing is so long and so lightweight, and so made out of plastic.
dataset/train/24_81.wav|It might go poorly. Bending from the back there is a minor flex, but no cracks or strange sounds
dataset/train/24_82.wav|so far. It does feel hollow inside, but when bent from the front we get the same results.
dataset/train/24_83.wav|A structurally sound creakless, crackless solid mobile gaming system. It's a pretty slick device.
dataset/train/24_84.wav|Having the ability to game anywhere, pause that game, and then pick up again where you left off
dataset/train/24_85.wav|from your computer is pretty nifty. And if you've made it this far in the video you've
dataset/train/24_86.wav|probably noticed that I do have more than one Steam Deck. Mine, which of course we'll take
dataset/train/24_87.wav|apart so we can explore the insides. But I do have this other one here still in pristine, unscratched
dataset/train/24_88.wav|condition. Owning two sold out Steam Decks is rather excessive so I'm going to give one away
dataset/train/24_89.wav|over on Twitter. Come follow me @ZacksJerryRig and I'll have a tweet up giving this one away within
dataset/train/24_90.wav|the next week. If you win I can always draw a Tesla valve on the back for you. Or better,
dataset/train/24_91.wav|I'll just include a full body protective Teardown Skin, quite possibly my favorite Teardown Skin
dataset/train/24_92.wav|yet. If you're one of the luckies who already has your Steam Deck, I'll leave a link for this
dataset/train/24_93.wav|Teardown Skin in the video description right next to dbrand's tempered glass screen protectors.
dataset/train/24_94.wav|So whether you're waiting for a Breath of the Wild 2, or Half Life 3,
dataset/train/24_95.wav|or just for your dad to get home from the gas station, we can all appreciate the
dataset/train/24_96.wav|effort that's been put into mobile consoles lately, and this Steam Deck continues the
dataset/train/24_97.wav|solid tradition of structurally sound mobile consoles. Come hang out with me on Instagram,
dataset/train/24_98.wav|and of course, over on Twitter for the giveaway. Leave any questions you have
dataset/train/24_99.wav|for the teardown video down in the comments. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/25_1.wav|Today in front of us we have the Xiaomi 12 Pro – a flagship that has about the same price and specs
dataset/train/25_2.wav|as the OnePlus 10 Pro (may it rest in peace). While the OnePlus 10 Pro
dataset/train/25_3.wav|might not have survived my durability test, today we're going to find out if the 12 Pro from Xiaomi
dataset/train/25_4.wav|is worth your hard earned money. Speaking of money, I've met several people throughout my
dataset/train/25_5.wav|life who have a head-in-the-sand approach to their bank account.
dataset/train/25_6.wav|Like maybe if we don't look at it all of the problems will solve themselves,
dataset/train/25_7.wav|which just isn't the case. You can't grow your financials without understanding your finances,
dataset/train/25_8.wav|which is where Truebill comes in. Huge thanks to Truebill for sponsoring this

dataset/train/25_21.wav|Now it's time to cross our fingers and hope that the Xiaomi
dataset/train/25_22.wav|12 Pro is a little more structurally sound than the OnePlus 10 Pro. Let's get started.
dataset/train/25_23.wav|Xiaomi has again released several variations of this phone, but left the name the same.
dataset/train/25_24.wav|In this case we have the Xiaomi 12X, then the 12 from the 12 Pro, which is this one. And
dataset/train/25_25.wav|finally the 4th Xiaomi 12 device called the Ultra that comes out in the next few months. It does
dataset/train/25_26.wav|get confusing. The Ultra might look a little different, but at least the other three 12's
dataset/train/25_27.wav|are visibly and structurally the same, so this durability test could count for the whole lineup.
dataset/train/25_28.wav|Inside the box we get a transparent rubber case, which is nice. Any protection is good
dataset/train/25_29.wav|protection. A huge perk of this phone is that it also comes with a 120 watt charger
dataset/train/25_30.wav|inside the box. This is massive amounts of power for a cellphone and can theoretically charge from
dataset/train/25_31.wav|0-100% in just 18 minutes. If you forget to plug your phone in at night you could still
dataset/train/25_32.wav|wake up in the morning and get a full charge by the time you're done eating breakfast.
dataset/train/25_33.wav|I thought the charging animation would be a bit cooler, but maybe we just have to wait for it
dataset/train/25_34.wav|to turn on. Other than the charging thing though I think this is a pretty normal everyday rectangular
dataset/train/25_35.wav|smartphone. Let's start with the scratch test. I have a set of Mohs mineral picks that can find the
dataset/train/25_36.wav|difference between different materials, and since this smartphone is in the $900 realm,
dataset/train/25_37.wav|we would expect it to not be made of plastic.
dataset/train/25_38.wav|The included screen protector, however, is indeed allowed to be.
dataset/train/25_39.wav|With that gone we can continue up the scale
dataset/train/25_40.wav|until we see scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/25_41.wav|The Xiaomi 12 Pro is using Gorilla Glass Victus.
dataset/train/25_42.wav|This same Victus Glass is also protecting the front facing camera as well, which is
dataset/train/25_43.wav|32 megapixels and capable of filming in 1080p. We also have a tiny ear slit up here at the top.
dataset/train/25_44.wav|This is just for the earpiece as the upper stereo loudspeaker has a much larger vent out the top.
dataset/train/25_45.wav|The sides of the phone are made from aluminum. We have dual antenna lines placed in the upper
dataset/train/25_46.wav|and lower thirds of the phone. Antenna lines have been known to cause structural issues in the past.
dataset/train/25_47.wav|The power and volume rocker are both made from metal and are not popping out like
dataset/train/25_48.wav|we see on the Samsung devices. The top of the phone has some Harman Kardon branding,
dataset/train/25_49.wav|along with the microphone hole,
dataset/train/25_50.wav|IR blaster, and the vent for the upper loudspeaker that we talked about earlier.
dataset/train/25_51.wav|The left side of the phone is pretty uneventful. Down at the bottom, however,
dataset/train/25_52.wav|we do have the lower loudspeaker vent, the 121 USB-C charging port, along with the SIM card tray
dataset/train/25_53.wav|that does not have storage. And while this tray does have a rubber ring for water-resistance,
dataset/train/25_54.wav|the phone itself does not come with an IP rating. The back glass of the Xiaomi 12 Pro is frosted,
dataset/train/25_55.wav|meaning that it has more of a satin feel instead of the smooth glass that we normally
dataset/train/25_56.wav|see on smartphones. And due to this microscopic texturing, the level 6 glass is acting like
dataset/train/25_57.wav|sandpaper to my level 5 razor blades. The 12 Pro has three cameras in the top corner, all of
dataset/train/25_58.wav|them are 50 megapixels. The large sensor is the one up top, and then a telephoto in the center,
dataset/train/25_59.wav|a dual toned flash, and then a wide angle camera down at the bottom - the Trifecta of perspectives.
dataset/train/25_60.wav|The lenses are covered with glass, but the hump itself is made from metal.
dataset/train/25_61.wav|The Xiaomi logo down at the bottom is just a blend of the etched and smooth glass texturing.
dataset/train/25_62.wav|It's actually kind of interesting how they make the etching on this glass.
dataset/train/25_63.wav|You can actually buy off the shelf glass etching cream at hobby shops or on Amazon for like $20.
dataset/train/25_64.wav|It's a type of sulfuric acid and sodium bifluoride combo that resembles toothpaste,
dataset/train/25_65.wav|except that if you brush your teeth with it you'll die. It can, however, create the type of frosted
dataset/train/25_66.wav|surface by eating away at the glass layer before it gets cleaned off. Let me know if you think we
dataset/train/25_67.wav|should buy some and try it on a phone sometime. A little hobby project with Jerry, if you will.
dataset/train/25_68.wav|As far as the flame goes on the 6.7 inch 1440p 120hertz display, the pixels lasted
dataset/train/25_69.wav|about 30 seconds before turning white and then remaining permanently damaged. The 12 Pro also
dataset/train/25_70.wav|does that thing where it can reduce the refresh rate down to 1 hertz to conserve battery life.
dataset/train/25_71.wav|And of course, now that the phone is on we can get a good look at what the charging animation
dataset/train/25_72.wav|is like when it's plugged in, and to be honest this 120 watts is pretty mind blowing.
dataset/train/25_73.wav|Visibly being able to see the battery percentage tick up is a
dataset/train/25_74.wav|pretty phenomenal advance from where battery technology used to be just a few years ago.
dataset/train/25_75.wav|Finally, we have the underscreen fingerprint scanner. I'll set my fingerprint real quick
dataset/train/25_76.wav|to make sure it's all readable. Then we can score the surface of the glass with excessive
dataset/train/25_77.wav|level 7 deeper grooves, more than the phone would ever see during its natural existence...unless,
dataset/train/25_78.wav|of course, it was owned by Edward Sisssorhands. But good news for
dataset/train/25_79.wav|Edward though is that the fingerprint scanner works just fine, even with the extra scratches.
dataset/train/25_80.wav|Now for the bend test. This is the structural assessment that every major phone has had to
dataset/train/25_81.wav|pass through for the last 7 years. Bending from the front we do see some minor flex in the frame
dataset/train/25_82.wav|and the back panel, but luckily none of the stress or flex is focused on the antenna lines
dataset/train/25_83.wav|that are off to either end. Smart placement by Xiaomi. Flipping the 12 Pro over, there
dataset/train/25_84.wav|is a loud popping sounds which scared me for a second, but the phone appears to still be working
dataset/train/25_85.wav|and in one piece. The repeatable popping sound is something coming from inside, moving out of
dataset/train/25_86.wav|position I assume. But then the phone locks out preventing any physical damage to the device.
dataset/train/25_87.wav|It'll be interesting to find out where that popping sound is coming from during the teardown.
dataset/train/25_88.wav|It is scary sounding, yes, but it is also still in one piece, so not too shabby. Nice work,
dataset/train/25_89.wav|Xiaomi. Your phones haven't always made it, but this 12 Pro has indeed survived.
dataset/train/25_90.wav|Let me know what phone you want to see tested next down in the comments. Come hang out with
dataset/train/25_91.wav|me on Instagram and Elon's Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/26_1.wav|So I kind of have a little addiction to transparent technology. Ever since the beginning
dataset/train/26_2.wav|of my whole life I've liked to take things apart and see how they work from the inside. Especially
dataset/train/26_3.wav|growing up in the 90s when even Apple, of all companies, was making transparent computers.
dataset/train/26_4.wav|So today I've collected quite a few different items from the 90s that are transparent so
dataset/train/26_5.wav|kids from today can see what they're missing out on. And since we're talking about transparent
dataset/train/26_6.wav|technology, it only makes sense that we release a fully transparent JerryRig Knife at the same time.
dataset/train/26_7.wav|I've been working on this transparent knife since we released the metal version about a year and a
dataset/train/26_8.wav|half ago. It's made from injected polycarbonate, the same stuff layered into bulletproof glass.
dataset/train/26_9.wav|This guys has the similar tessellated hexagonal patterns as the metal knives,
dataset/train/26_10.wav|but this time around it's optically clear with full visibility on every internal stainless
dataset/train/26_11.wav|steel component. There is a 2 ounce reduction in weight when compared to the full metal knife,
dataset/train/26_12.wav|but the impact resistance and durability is still phenomenal.
dataset/train/26_13.wav|I wouldn't be selling anything less. My favorite part is how you can see the spring
dataset/train/26_14.wav|and locking mechanisms fit together just like a little Lego. It's what locks the blade into
dataset/train/26_15.wav|place and we can see it all without taking it apart. The replacement razor blade still only
dataset/train/26_16.wav|costs pennies and is available at nearly every hardware store around the world.
dataset/train/26_17.wav|And people might think I'm crazy, but I am selling these for just $14.99. I can't promise that the
dataset/train/26_18.wav|price will stay that way forever, but I do think these are super cool and I want everyone to have
dataset/train/26_19.wav|one. Since I did use this one on camera, however, I am going to slip $20 inside the
dataset/train/26_20.wav|box and some lucky person who buys one today is going to get some extra cash inside of the box.
dataset/train/26_21.wav|A little thank you for letting me unbox your knife on camera. You can grab them at JerryRigKnife.com.
dataset/train/26_22.wav|And now I think it's time to unbox some more clear tech from the 90's. Let's get started.
dataset/train/26_23.wav|We might as well start back at the beginning with my atomic purple Game
dataset/train/26_24.wav|Boy Color that I purchased back in 1998 when I was 10 years old.
dataset/train/26_25.wav|As you can tell from the expired batteries, I haven't played for a while. I had a newspaper
dataset/train/26_26.wav|route where I would ride my bike to deliver newspapers to people in my neighborhood.
dataset/train/26_27.wav|For you youngins, a newspaper is like a tweet, but with more words and less cookies.
dataset/train/26_28.wav|For you old people, cookies are like creepy stalkers on the electronic typewriter.
dataset/train/26_29.wav|This Game Boy Color had a launch price of $69.99, and it took me quite a while to save
dataset/train/26_30.wav|up enough money to buy it, especially since I do remember hitting someone's glass screen door with
dataset/train/26_31.wav|the newspaper and shattering the whole thing, which, of course, I personally had to pay for
dataset/train/26_32.wav|because glass is glass. But I finally did get my hands on the transparent Game Boy Color
dataset/train/26_33.wav|and it's still working to this very day 24 years later. Nice work, Nintendo.
dataset/train/26_34.wav|Now let's check what's inside this first box. I gotta use my clear JerryRig Knife of course.
dataset/train/26_35.wav|You've seen my own version of transparent phones where we remove the coloring
dataset/train/26_36.wav|inside of the cell phone glass. You've probably even seen my Teardown Skins from
dataset/train/26_37.wav|dbrand where we can show off the insides of phones without voiding the warranties.
dataset/train/26_38.wav|But this guy, a landline phone, was ahead of its time 30 years ago back in 1993.
dataset/train/26_39.wav|It's all clear to show off every single internal component, resistor, and interestingly enough,
dataset/train/26_40.wav|weights. You can see a weight in the center of the base, as well as up here in the bottom of the
dataset/train/26_41.wav|handheld side near the mouthpiece to help balance things out. Also take a look at the transparent
dataset/train/26_42.wav|phone cable running up to the handset. I haven't had a landline in my house for a few years now so
dataset/train/26_43.wav|I have no way of testing this guy. And even the company, Bell Atlantic, isn't a thing anymore
dataset/train/26_44.wav|since they were bought out by Verizon in the year 2000, but this thing is still pretty cool.
dataset/train/26_45.wav|I'll slip another $20 into this knife for a lucky person since I used it on camera.
dataset/train/26_46.wav|Another relic of the 1990s is this vintage Ken-Tech alarm clock.
dataset/train/26_47.wav|Once again we can see all the internal components, speakers, buttons, and wiring.
dataset/train/26_48.wav|I'm starting to think that maybe the reason millenials have such a hard time
dataset/train/26_49.wav|waking up these days isn't the crippling student debt or overvalued housing market,
dataset/train/26_50.wav|it's probably because our alarm clocks aren't as cool as they used to be. I'll slip another
dataset/train/26_51.wav|$20 into this knife for a lucky person. It'll probably go towards finger reattachment surgery.
dataset/train/26_52.wav|The transparent knife can be opened and closed with one hand by the way. I've been carrying a
dataset/train/26_53.wav|razor-style knife in my pocket every day for the last 15 years or so, so I've gotten pretty good at
dataset/train/26_54.wav|it. But keep in mind that razors are literally the sharpest knife on the planet, and like with any
dataset/train/26_55.wav|knife, if you're not paying attention, physical damage to your digits is a real possibility.
dataset/train/26_56.wav|Let's check out some of the more recent additions to the transparent tech lineup.
dataset/train/26_57.wav|We have a transparent CD player, as well as a transparent portable cassette player,
dataset/train/26_58.wav|with transparent headphones included. Not all transparent tech is for aesthetic reasons though.
dataset/train/26_59.wav|Some of it is practical as well. Like in prisons the only technology allowed inside for the
dataset/train/26_60.wav|inmates, like radios, TVs, or sound equipment all have to be clear so nothing can be hidden
dataset/train/26_61.wav|inside or transported. And it's easy to tell at a glance that there are no additional things
dataset/train/26_62.wav|inside like cell phones or weapons filling up the empty space. So whether you're in prison or not,
dataset/train/26_63.wav|you know, preferably not, these are still available today for purchase because of the demand
dataset/train/26_64.wav|from the prison system. The same thing applies to our next item. I'll just grab a new clear knife.
dataset/train/26_65.wav|The last transparent piece of technology we have is this guy here.
dataset/train/26_66.wav|It's a relatively modern 720p 13-inch LED TV. It's a little on the dirty side since it was actually
dataset/train/26_67.wav|used by someone in prison. They have their prison number scratched into clear plastic here on the
dataset/train/26_68.wav|back so no one steals it. And it's easy to tell at a glance that there are no additional pieces
dataset/train/26_69.wav|of contraband inside besides just the TV components that are supposed to be there. It
dataset/train/26_70.wav|does have stickers on the side that say if it's broken it will result in disciplinary action.
dataset/train/26_71.wav|Big yikes in jail if these are ever taken apart. Apple and jail have something
dataset/train/26_72.wav|in common. But luckily, since it's clear, we can satisfy our curiosity without any tools
dataset/train/26_73.wav|or risk of disciplinary action. Power comes in from the main board and then branches out to
dataset/train/26_74.wav|power everything else, like the screen and all these ports down at the bottom including HDMI.
dataset/train/26_75.wav|Transparent stuff in prison might look pretty awesome,
dataset/train/26_76.wav|and you might be like, wow, I should just go to jail for all the cool tech.
dataset/train/26_77.wav|But you can tell from the screen quality that resolution isn't the highest priority here. And
dataset/train/26_78.wav|we did get extremely lucky with this model, that there is a speaker down at the bottom
dataset/train/26_79.wav|because most prison devices only have a headphone jack so we aren't disturbing the other inmates.
dataset/train/26_80.wav|So I mean, transparent technology kind of was mainstream back in the 90s, and it's whittled
dataset/train/26_81.wav|down to just the current prison population, but I can see it making a comeback. Gaming PCs are
dataset/train/26_82.wav|almost all transparent, as well as we have a transparent Skin for nearly every smartphone.
dataset/train/26_83.wav|And now we also have my transparent JerryRig Knife. And for those of you keeping track at home,
dataset/train/26_84.wav|this now brings our color selection up to four. We have transparent, metal, red, and blue.
dataset/train/26_85.wav|And if we're keeping with the 90s vibe, you got to catch 'em all. Plus 5 of the knives that I
dataset/train/26_86.wav|ship out today as a thank you for letting me use them on camera, are going to be shipped with $20
dataset/train/26_87.wav|inside of the package. So there will be 5 lucky people with extra cash, but everyone
dataset/train/26_88.wav|who orders a transparent JerryRig Knife will end up with a transparent JerryRig Knife.
dataset/train/26_89.wav|Have you ever owned a transparent piece of tech that I might have missed? Let me know
dataset/train/26_90.wav|down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram. JerryRigKnife.com
dataset/train/26_91.wav|is where you find the knives. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/27_1.wav|This Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is by far the largest tablet we have ever durability tested. And yeah,
dataset/train/27_2.wav|I think I know what's going to happen, and you think you know what's going to happen.
dataset/train/27_3.wav|But there's that small chance, like with the iPad Pro, that we get surprised. This is almost a full
dataset/train/27_4.wav|millimeter thinner than the iPad Pro though, so I have my doubts. The only way to find out for sure
dataset/train/27_5.wav|is by doing a durability test. I was, however, super surprised that the box was shipped out
dataset/train/27_6.wav|this thin. We can already tell that there's no charger inside of it. Speaking of shipping though,
dataset/train/27_7.wav|huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. I've been using Stamps.com for the last few
dataset/train/27_8.wav|years to ship out my JerryRig knives and Whisper Project t-shirts. It's been super helpful when
dataset/train/27_9.wav|comparing shipping rates and getting exclusive discounts from UPS and USPS all year long.
dataset/train/27_10.wav|And those discounts I can pass directly onto you guys. That way my stuff doesn't have to be
dataset/train/27_11.wav|expensive. Plus one of my favorite things is that I can do everything right here from my own house
dataset/train/27_12.wav|without standing in lines or taking unnecessary trips to the post office. Don't just take my word
dataset/train/27_13.wav|for it, Stamps.com has been helping over 1 million small businesses for the last 20 years save time
dataset/train/27_14.wav|and money. And you won't find these discounts anywhere else. Up to 40% off of USPS and 76%
dataset/train/27_15.wav|off of UPS. Time is money and Stamps.com helps you save both.
dataset/train/27_16.wav|Head to Stamps.com/JerryRig for a four week trial, free postage, and a free 5 pound digital scale,
dataset/train/27_17.wav|with no long term commitments or contracts. Stamps.com/JerryRig and you can be up and
dataset/train/27_18.wav|running in minutes with just a normal computer and a normal printer. And I'll get back to shipping
dataset/train/27_19.wav|out the knives and t-shirts as soon as we finish with this durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/27_20.wav|This Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tablet is huge. Far larger than anything Apple sells. The
dataset/train/27_21.wav|largest Apple iPad is 12.9 inches, and this bad boy is a solid 14.6.
dataset/train/27_22.wav|Inside the box we get the TV size gadget, along with the s-pen, a SIM card removal tool for the
dataset/train/27_23.wav|expandable memory, and some documents, as well as a very long USB-C cable. But no charging brick.
dataset/train/27_24.wav|As far as the price goes, this Tab S8 currently retails for about $1099, which does match Apple's
dataset/train/27_25.wav|price for the iPad Pro. However, Apple does not include the Apple pencil in the box, where Samsung
dataset/train/27_26.wav|does. This s-pen mounts and receives its charge through the glass panel near the camera lens.
dataset/train/27_27.wav|Samsung is still calling this guy an s-pen even though it's very different from the s-pen styluses
dataset/train/27_28.wav|we find inside of the phones. As you can see from the s-pen inside of my Note 10 Plus,
dataset/train/27_29.wav|it's very much smaller than the one included with the Galaxy Tab...at least that's how it appears on
dataset/train/27_30.wav|the outside. One the inside, however, once we snap it open it's a very different story. Tucked inside
dataset/train/27_31.wav|of the larger housing is the exact same hardware from the baby s-pen. It's like a nesting doll.
dataset/train/27_32.wav|It still has the copper coil, circuit board, as well as a little capacitor at the top that allows
dataset/train/27_33.wav|the pen to do its gestures and act as a remote for the camera. It does have a larger mounting
dataset/train/27_34.wav|magnet on the side, but the top half of the pen is just filled up with a large plastic spacer
dataset/train/27_35.wav|and one additional magnet to keep the pen secured to the glass. Very interesting. I imagine we'll
dataset/train/27_36.wav|be able to see how it all connects from the inside of the tablet here in just a few seconds.
dataset/train/27_37.wav|Let's continue with the scratch test. Samsung has made this tablet about the same size and
dataset/train/27_38.wav|shape as a normal piece of paper, just a tad longer in the hot dog direction.
dataset/train/27_39.wav|They've somehow managed to cram a whole screen, motherboard, 11,200 milliamp hour battery,
dataset/train/27_40.wav|and frame into a body that's just 5.5 millimeters thick.
dataset/train/27_41.wav|It's insanely thin. For Americans that's about 10 razor blades stacked on top of each other. And as
dataset/train/27_42.wav|we see from the scratch test, glass is indeed the top layer of this technological sandwich,
dataset/train/27_43.wav|with scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. This means that up here at the top
dataset/train/27_44.wav|notch these two cameras are also protected by that same screen glass. Both of these cameras
dataset/train/27_45.wav|are 12 megapixels, one with a normal lens and one with a wide angle lens. It's kind of hard to get
dataset/train/27_46.wav|this whole thing in frame on my desk, but Samsung is still indeed using the microplastic protection
dataset/train/27_47.wav|all around the edges. It's the same clear clingy bits that we find on all Samsung cellphones.
dataset/train/27_48.wav|The right side is made from metal, with two of the 4 loudspeakers and a USB-C port. Flipping
dataset/train/27_49.wav|it over long-ways, we can check out the top real estate with its SD card slot, microphone hole,
dataset/train/27_50.wav|metal volume rocker, and metal power button. One of the perks of this tablet over the iPad
dataset/train/27_51.wav|is the external storage slot that allows for an additional one terabyte of removable memory
dataset/train/27_52.wav|in the form of an SD card. And I don't want to be keeping score or anything,
dataset/train/27_53.wav|but for the same price, this Tab S8 is bigger, comes with the stylus, and has expandable storage.
dataset/train/27_54.wav|As long as it doesn't snap in half it does seem like a pretty decent tablet.
dataset/train/27_55.wav|Personally, I'm more of a laptop guy, but I can see why tablet people do their thing.
dataset/train/27_56.wav|It also has attachment points at the bottom for a physical keyboard.
dataset/train/27_57.wav|One hobby or profession that appreciates a larger screen are digital artists.
dataset/train/27_58.wav|And I don't want to brag or anything but I'm somewhat of an artist myself,
dataset/train/27_59.wav|I just don't usually use the screen side. The back of the Tab S8 Ultra does have the Samsung logo
dataset/train/27_60.wav|inlaid onto the metal. Personally I think it looks kind of cool without the lettering in
dataset/train/27_61.wav|place – a little more subtle. The s-pen docking and charging location is glass, along with the
dataset/train/27_62.wav|covering that's over the dual cameras. A 13 megapixel normal camera and 6 megapixel
dataset/train/27_63.wav|ultra wide camera. They're definitely not the best cameras Samsung has ever come out with,
dataset/train/27_64.wav|but like I said earlier, this tablet is probably more made for artists rather than photographers.
dataset/train/27_65.wav|Speaking of which, I'm a pretty big fan of dinosaurs.
dataset/train/27_66.wav|Like "Jurassic Park sounds like a good time." Level enthusiast over here.
dataset/train/27_67.wav|However, I did attempt to draw a dinosaur back in 2017 on the back of the Pixel 2 XL. And like,
dataset/train/27_68.wav|I did an okay job, but let's see if there's been any improvement over the last five years.
dataset/train/27_69.wav|You know, I've had some time to perfect my craft.
dataset/train/27_70.wav|Let me know what you think down in the comments. Did I do good with this new dino buddy?
dataset/train/27_71.wav|Or should I buy a few more tablets and keep practicing?
dataset/train/27_72.wav|Feel free to be honest, I can take the heat. You know, who can't take the heat though?
dataset/train/27_73.wav|Dinosaurs. I'll position the lighter over here on the weather app icon since that seems to be
dataset/train/27_74.wav|increasingly relevant lately. Samsung has put a 14.6 inch AMOLED panel on this S8 Ultra, along
dataset/train/27_75.wav|with 120 hertz HDR 10 plus. And it lasts for about 25 seconds under the heat from my flame before
dataset/train/27_76.wav|going white and getting permanently damaged. And it actually looks super cool. The adhesive between
dataset/train/27_77.wav|the glass and pixels seems to have bubbled up and tye-dyed a portion of the pixels in
dataset/train/27_78.wav|different shades. Kind of like a burn gradient as heat moves away from the epicenter. Once again
dataset/train/27_79.wav|this task doesn't show us much, I just started doing it 6 years ago and can't seem to stop.
dataset/train/27_80.wav|The last thing I want to check though before we turn this tablet into a foldable
dataset/train/27_81.wav|is the fingerprint scanner. Everywhere online says this is an optical scanner,
dataset/train/27_82.wav|but judging by the minimal light and thinness of the display while setting my fingerprint,
dataset/train/27_83.wav|I'm curious if it's actually ultrasonic. We should find out soon enough. Luckily,
dataset/train/27_84.wav|even after adding my copious amounts of level 7 deeper grooves over the surface of the scanner,
dataset/train/27_85.wav|it still manages to read my fingerprint and unlock the screen every single time. Nice work, Samsung.
dataset/train/27_86.wav|Finally, the bend test. Remember, for 2 years in a row Apple's iPad crumbled like crackers up until
dataset/train/27_87.wav|last year when the new M1 iPad finally survived. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 also survived,
dataset/train/27_88.wav|but none of them were as large or as thin as this Samsung Tab S8 Ultra.
dataset/train/27_89.wav|With the first bend from the back we actually get some hefty curvature,
dataset/train/27_90.wav|but no cracking. It did however fight back and pinch multiple of my fingers very solidly between
dataset/train/27_91.wav|the glass screen and metal housing. Now if it looks like this hurts, I can indeed confirm that
dataset/train/27_92.wav|that observation is correct. There are now parts of me inside this tablet in ways I never imagined.
dataset/train/27_93.wav|It is, however, still alive and functional, contrasting very much to the stolen portions of my
dataset/train/27_94.wav|epidermis. Flipping the tablet around and bending it from the screen side, we get a decent flex,
dataset/train/27_95.wav|but no creaking, cracking, or breaking. It's still frustratingly in one piece. Normally I try
dataset/train/27_96.wav|to stay objective during my durability test, but today I opened this box fully expecting carnage
dataset/train/27_97.wav|but instead it took a bite out of me while receiving no structural damage in return.
dataset/train/27_98.wav|And I am a decently large person, so according to the current laws of the universe, it should snap.
dataset/train/27_99.wav|I'm not sure what physics-defying black magic Samsung constructed this thing with,
dataset/train/27_100.wav|but the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra has survived my durability test
dataset/train/27_101.wav|and I'm very impressed. My mind is blown, and I'm going to go rethink my life.
dataset/train/27_102.wav|As always, snag a JerryRig Knife for yourself with the link in the description. Come hang out
dataset/train/27_103.wav|with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/28_1.wav|I'm making this video for two reasons. One, I forgot to show you the uniquely
dataset/train/28_2.wav|positioned vibrator inside of the S22 Ultra. And two, one question I get surprisingly often
dataset/train/28_3.wav|is what happens if I were to accidentally put my SIM card removal tool into the microphone opening?
dataset/train/28_4.wav|It's a valid question. Will the SIM card tool damage the microphone, or worse,
dataset/train/28_5.wav|the water resistance? Today we're going to find out what happens when we put it in the wrong hole.
dataset/train/28_6.wav|It should be interesting. Let's get started.
dataset/train/28_7.wav|Before we stab all of these phones in the microphone hole, let's find that S22
dataset/train/28_8.wav|Ultra vibrator. If you remember in my S22 Ultra teardown video I don't mention the vibrator at all
dataset/train/28_9.wav|and that's because it's not visible. Out of sight, out of mind. I just plumb forgot
dataset/train/28_10.wav|it's existence. It turns out though there is a vibrator and it's hidden, for some reason,
dataset/train/28_11.wav|inside the lower loudspeaker. I just gotta drain the balls first. These little guys provide more
dataset/train/28_12.wav|surface area for the sound inside the speaker to reverberate off of, making the speaker sound
dataset/train/28_13.wav|bigger than it actually is. Car auto enthusiasts have been stuffing subwoofer boxes for ages
dataset/train/28_14.wav|to get this same effect. And apparently, another interesting and very creative trick
dataset/train/28_15.wav|to making the speaker box bigger is to actually throw an entire vibrator inside. I'm not going
dataset/train/28_16.wav|to pretend to understand the intricacies of what this accomplishes acoustically since it looks like
dataset/train/28_17.wav|it occupies all the additional space it creates inside that loudspeaker enclosure. Of course there
dataset/train/28_18.wav|are air pockets inside of the vibrator which would give a spot for the sound to bounce off of. We can
dataset/train/28_19.wav|try to break open the laser welded enclosure to see what it looks like from the inside.
dataset/train/28_20.wav|Opening like a can of sardines, this guy is an x-axis haptic vibrator,
dataset/train/28_21.wav|which means it can provide very specific vibrations, differentiating between
dataset/train/28_22.wav|different tasks like keyboard presses or phone calls. It's very different to open.
dataset/train/28_23.wav|But with the lid now sliced and lifted you can see the copper coils of the motor
dataset/train/28_24.wav|that would allow the innards to get wiggly jiggly if I didn't crush the mcjibblets out of it.
dataset/train/28_25.wav|It's a cool concept though so if you own an S22 Ultra, let us know down in the
dataset/train/28_26.wav|comments if the speaker or vibrator works any better with this new symbiotic relationship.
dataset/train/28_27.wav|It's definitely not a match I would have predicted, but it is 2022 and anything can happen.
dataset/train/28_28.wav|Now let's find out what happens when we put the SIM card tool into the wrong hole.
dataset/train/28_29.wav|Since Samsung has very dangerously both holes right next to each other,
dataset/train/28_30.wav|if you're not paying attention a tool could very easily slide into the wrong one.
dataset/train/28_31.wav|If you notice with the bottom board removed, even though the microphone hole is big enough to accept
dataset/train/28_32.wav|the SIM card tool, all of the fragile components are positioned off to the side of the shaft,
dataset/train/28_33.wav|like the waterproofing screen. It's resting on the roof of the shaft instead of at the end,
dataset/train/28_34.wav|placed in a way that would be impossible to puncture. Plus it looks like the shaft even
dataset/train/28_35.wav|narrows before it gets to the waterproofing so the tool does stop before it even gets to this point.
dataset/train/28_36.wav|The gold square of a microphone is also positioned above the shaft, so again there's a zero percent
dataset/train/28_37.wav|chance of it getting nicked during any accidental pokes. The S22 Ultra is safe.
dataset/train/28_38.wav|Let's take a look at the OnePlus 10 Pro since it also has the microphone hole positioned right next
dataset/train/28_39.wav|to the SIM card tray. One of the problems with designing products for the general public is that
dataset/train/28_40.wav|the general public is very, you know, diverse. For example a forest ranger at Yosemite once said
dataset/train/28_41.wav|that it's hard to make a bear-proof trash can because there is considerable overlap between
dataset/train/28_42.wav|the intelligence of the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists. Now obviously if you
dataset/train/28_43.wav|put your SIM card tool in the wrong hole you're not dumb. The holes are literally right next to
dataset/train/28_44.wav|each other and the same size, so it's very easy to confuse the two. We just hope that the designers
dataset/train/28_45.wav|of these phones anticipate and plan for these accidental pokes. And it looks like the OnePlus
dataset/train/28_46.wav|10 Pro is prepared for this with the waterproofing membrane once again placed at the top of the shaft
dataset/train/28_47.wav|and not the end. And the gold microphone box is resting above that membrane. No damage could ever
dataset/train/28_48.wav|happen to the microphone or waterproofing with this phone either. The OnePlus 10 Pro is safe.
dataset/train/28_49.wav|Now for the iPhones. And this applies from the iPhone 10 all the way to the
dataset/train/28_50.wav|iPhone 15 since Apple doesn't change anything but the name and price.
dataset/train/28_51.wav|Microphone hole penetration isn't as big of a deal here since the SIM card tray is on the side
dataset/train/28_52.wav|and the microphone hole is down at the bottom. The microphone is mounted, once again, above the shaft
dataset/train/28_53.wav|so it won't be punctured if anything slips in. The hole itself though is blocked by metal mesh,
dataset/train/28_54.wav|and this mesh if it were to get punctured would not be water resistant anymore,
dataset/train/28_55.wav|but it would be very hard to accomplish that on accident. The iPhone is safe.
dataset/train/28_56.wav|Let's take a look at the Pixel 6 Pro's holes since we're on a roll. Like the iPhones,
dataset/train/28_57.wav|this Pixel does not have a SIM card tray and microphone next to each other.
dataset/train/28_58.wav|The SIM card tray is again on the side with a speaker and one microphone at the bottom,
dataset/train/28_59.wav|and a second microphone in the plastic section up at the top. Lifting up the screen we can
dataset/train/28_60.wav|unplug it just like a little Lego. And a few more screws release the top earpiece speaker.
dataset/train/28_61.wav|Now this layout is slightly different. Of course I can poke through the microphone
dataset/train/28_62.wav|hole on the top side of the phone, which can go into the microphone channel of the speaker.
dataset/train/28_63.wav|But again, off to the bottom side of the shaft this time, we have the waterproofing mesh,
dataset/train/28_64.wav|and that microphone itself is mounted below that shaft instead of above.
dataset/train/28_65.wav|But still impervious to accidental stabs. So far so good. Every phone we've checked is safe.
dataset/train/28_66.wav|Let's finish off with the Mi 11 to see if Xiaomi has also anticipated poke happy people.
dataset/train/28_67.wav|The SIM card tray is down here at the bottom, and the microphone is here as well, but farther away
dataset/train/28_68.wav|on the other side of the USB-C port which is a good placement from an anti-accidental
dataset/train/28_69.wav|skewering perspective. With the back off and the screws loose we can tell once again that the
dataset/train/28_70.wav|waterproofing is off to the side of the shaft, but it's interesting to see that this time the
dataset/train/28_71.wav|diameter of the shaft does extend all the way to the back end of the chamber, which means the SIM
dataset/train/28_72.wav|card tool can fully penetrate into the hole. But it's still in no way able to puncture that water
dataset/train/28_73.wav|resistant layer or get to the microphone that's off to the side. The Xiaomi Mi 11 is also safe.
dataset/train/28_74.wav|And there we have it. Five phones with slightly different, yet still effective solutions
dataset/train/28_75.wav|to keeping your phone damage free if that SIM card removal tool enters where it shouldn't.
dataset/train/28_76.wav|As we know, to err is human and it's nice that smartphone designers have foresight enough
dataset/train/28_77.wav|to anticipate this potentially catastrophic event and design phones that prevent punctures before
dataset/train/28_78.wav|they ever happen. So if you've ever stabbed a microphone hole with a SIM card tool, you may now
dataset/train/28_79.wav|rest assured that your phone is not compromised or broken and still has all of his water resistance
dataset/train/28_80.wav|intact. Thumbs up for that. If you think 10 fingers are too many, you can always help
dataset/train/28_81.wav|support the channel by getting one of my razor knives. I'll leave a link down in the description.

dataset/train/29_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart the brand new Galaxy S22 Ultra... the one we did our durability
dataset/train/29_2.wav|test on. In the previous video we took apart the s-pen. This is what's left of it. And in today's
dataset/train/29_3.wav|video we're going to see how the S22 works from the inside and how they manage to waterproof the
dataset/train/29_4.wav|s-pen hole in the bottom because it's one of the biggest holes in a smartphone that has ever needed
dataset/train/29_5.wav|to be watertight. Want to know what else is tight? Your first 3 months free with the SiriusXM app.

dataset/train/29_13.wav|SiriusXM.com/jerryrigoffer. The app works on phones, smart speakers, TVs, and even computers.
dataset/train/29_14.wav|I like that here's a large selection of news reporting as well because with everything going
dataset/train/29_15.wav|on it's always good to stay informed. Find your groove on the SiriusXM's streaming platinum plan
dataset/train/29_16.wav|and get your first three months free with a subscription. Now it's time to
dataset/train/29_17.wav|dive inside of the Galaxy S22 Ultra to see inside the s-pen cavity. Let's get started.
dataset/train/29_18.wav|The S22 Ultra is probably the most powerful Android phone on the market...at the moment.
dataset/train/29_19.wav|I say most powerful but remember it's only a super small increase over last year and the year before.
dataset/train/29_20.wav|Personally I think smartphones have kind of plateaued and any phone from the last 3 years
dataset/train/29_21.wav|is still pretty great and can kind of compete in the same realm. Even the design hasn't changed
dataset/train/29_22.wav|that much. On this S22 Ultra we have the adhesive attached glass back that Samsung's been using for
dataset/train/29_23.wav|the past 7 years with the same removal steps: with a whole lot of heat and quite a bit of slicing,
dataset/train/29_24.wav|that softened adhesive from around the edges. Once it's cut away, we can get our first look
dataset/train/29_25.wav|inside of the S22 Ultra. It's interesting to note that inside of the glass back the
dataset/train/29_26.wav|5 individual camera circles are all attached on the same metal lens body. Kind of cool.
dataset/train/29_27.wav|We do have a wireless charging coil back here. This guy can charge up the
dataset/train/29_28.wav|phone at 15 watts and reverse wireless charge other devices at about 5 watts.
dataset/train/29_29.wav|These copper coils are pretty cool and we'll come back to them in a minute.
dataset/train/29_30.wav|The top of the phone has 9 normal Phillips head screws holding everything down.
dataset/train/29_31.wav|They are the same size which is convenient. I can detach the metal plate which has a NFC pad and a
dataset/train/29_32.wav|Lego-style connector, and then the battery with it's own Lego-style connector can be unplugged.
dataset/train/29_33.wav|The top plastics also come loose at this point. Then we can head down south and remove the 6
dataset/train/29_34.wav|silver Phillips head screws holding down the bottom. At first glance I thought this time
dataset/train/29_35.wav|around the lower loudspeaker might not have any balls inside, but it turns out they're
dataset/train/29_36.wav|all dropped inside of the unit from over here on the edge of the speaker...it's still got them.
dataset/train/29_37.wav|With the plastics gone I can remove the 3 super long extension ribbons that connect the top board
dataset/train/29_38.wav|with the bottom board. And three more screws that hold the charging port board in place.
dataset/train/29_39.wav|After removing the SIM card tray the bottom board can be taken out. The 45 watt USB-C port does have
dataset/train/29_40.wav|a red rubber ring around the tip to help out that ingress protection. Another point that
dataset/train/29_41.wav|water can get inside the phone is down here by the loudspeaker. Samsung is once again using rubber
dataset/train/29_42.wav|and a watertight mesh to keep water out which is all very securely glued to the frame of the phone.
dataset/train/29_43.wav|Samsung is pretty much a master of glue, as you'll see in a minute, but when it comes to
dataset/train/29_44.wav|waterproofing screens, that's totally fine and a valid purpose for using strong adhesive. The same
dataset/train/29_45.wav|thing goes for the microphone hole mesh as well. Before we can check out the s-pen's waterproofing,
dataset/train/29_46.wav|let's remove the motherboard. I'll unplug the s-pen charger, the s-pen screen digitizer,
dataset/train/29_47.wav|along with the front facing camera. Then the motherboard is free. It's interesting that with
dataset/train/29_48.wav|the motherboard out we can now unplug and detach the camera units and it really goes to show just
dataset/train/29_49.wav|how much real estate is dedicated to these cameras inside of the phone. They take up an impressive
dataset/train/29_50.wav|amount of space. The camera block has a 12 megapixel wide angle camera up top which does not
dataset/train/29_51.wav|have OIS. Then the 108 megapixel main camera in the center which does have OIS. The 10 megapixel
dataset/train/29_52.wav|3x telephoto also has OIS. And finally the big boy unit down at the bottom is a 10 megapixel 10x
dataset/train/29_53.wav|telephoto camera which also has the optical image stabilization but it's all internal encapsulated
dataset/train/29_54.wav|inside of the periscope since the sensor is at a 90 degree angle from that rear lens. I took apart
dataset/train/29_55.wav|one of these in my Galaxy S20 video if you want to see how it works, but it is indeed anti-jiggle.
dataset/train/29_56.wav|The motherboard is also dual stacked. A whole lot of technology in a super small form factor.
dataset/train/29_57.wav|The top loudspeaker also has balls of its own. The speaker has balls in two locations
dataset/train/29_58.wav|and I'm no expert on ball to speaker ratios but Samsung obviously thinks that a lot of balls are
dataset/train/29_59.wav|a good thing. They do help the speaker sound louder than it actually is since there is more
dataset/train/29_60.wav|surface area inside for the sound to reverberate off of. The frame is milled out of aluminum,
dataset/train/29_61.wav|probably one of the reasons why it has so much strength during the bend test.
dataset/train/29_62.wav|Finally, let's work on this battery so we can check out the s-pen enclosure. For the past ever
dataset/train/29_63.wav|Samsung has been extremely excessive with how they attach batteries to their phones. I'll drip some
dataset/train/29_64.wav|isopropyl alcohol in here to start softening the adhesive while we see how the s-pen enclosure is
dataset/train/29_65.wav|made watertight. The s-pen is charged by this little tiny coil of copper here at the top.
dataset/train/29_66.wav|The energy goes from the motherboard into the coil and wirelessly transfers into the copper coils of
dataset/train/29_67.wav|the s-pen's tip and down to the tiny capacitor at the other end of the pen, the side closest to the
dataset/train/29_68.wav|bottom of the phone. It's interesting to see how it works. Now, when milling out the body of the
dataset/train/29_69.wav|S22 Ultra, it would have been extremely difficult and expensive to just drill an s-pen sized hole
dataset/train/29_70.wav|through the middle of the block. Difficult to line everything up just right. Plus if it were
dataset/train/29_71.wav|just a hole drilled into the metal it would no longer be able to charge wirelessly. So to solve
dataset/train/29_72.wav|those two issues, charging and expensiveness, Samsung has actually made their s-pen compartment
dataset/train/29_73.wav|watertight with a thick piece of plastic glued down over the top of the hole, which is smart.
dataset/train/29_74.wav|It saves time and money and still allows them to charge the s-pen while it's inside of the phone.
dataset/train/29_75.wav|There is a little piece of rubber at the end of the channel to protect the tip of the
dataset/train/29_76.wav|s-pen from ever hitting metal. It keeps it from flattening out. But yeah, it looks solid to me.
dataset/train/29_77.wav|And the adhesive making the plastic watertight seems just as strong on the s-pen hole as it does
dataset/train/29_78.wav|on all the other ip68 ingress points. So thumbs up for that. Adhesive is normally a good thing.
dataset/train/29_79.wav|Now every smartphone manufacturer uses some kind of adhesive on the battery as well. Don't
dataset/train/29_80.wav|get me wrong, adhesive is the norm. Apple uses magic pull tabs, and everyone else like OnePlus,
dataset/train/29_81.wav|usually uses that adhesive gentle enough that batteries can be removed by hand...usually.
dataset/train/29_82.wav|Samsung, however, locks down their battery like it's going into space. There's more white web
dataset/train/29_83.wav|in here than an entire Spiderman movie, like a straight jacket of glue. And yeah,
dataset/train/29_84.wav|I get that Samsung has had bad experiences with batteries, but when they use an apocalyptic amount
dataset/train/29_85.wav|of adhesive, it makes the battery a lot harder to be recycled at the end of it's lifespan.
dataset/train/29_86.wav|Lithium batteries are 95% recyclable at this point in phones and electric vehicles. But they are only
dataset/train/29_87.wav|able to be recycled if it's easy to separate them from the rest of the materials inside of
dataset/train/29_88.wav|the phone. It would be very worthwhile for the planet for Samsung to implement a better form of
dataset/train/29_89.wav|adhesion. It would benefit repairability as well of course, but with Samsung selling 250 million
dataset/train/29_90.wav|phones every year, recycling is pretty important as the devices fade out. We gotta think long term.
dataset/train/29_91.wav|There is a copper heat pipe under the battery ready to dissipate heat from the motherboard out
dataset/train/29_92.wav|through the screen, but yeah, for me personally, the recycling aspect is pretty darn important.
dataset/train/29_93.wav|I do wish Samsung were designing their phones in a way that facilitates the end-of-life experience.
dataset/train/29_94.wav|So even though I don't need to upgrade my 2 ½ year old phone at the moment, when the time does come,
dataset/train/29_95.wav|I probably won't be picking a Samsung phone until they attach their batteries better. There
dataset/train/29_96.wav|are plenty of good phones out there to choose from so there's no need to pick one that makes
dataset/train/29_97.wav|recycling difficult. And, you know I really hate to say it, but Apple is looking pretty
dataset/train/29_98.wav|good environmentally-wise with their new repair program, longevity, and end-of-life experience. So
dataset/train/29_99.wav|an iPhone is not off the table. It feels a little dirty to say, but I said it. Luckily,
dataset/train/29_100.wav|I don't have to decide any time soon since my current phone is still working great. But
dataset/train/29_101.wav|one phone that's not working great, however, is this one. Normally when I reassemble my teardowns
dataset/train/29_102.wav|they work, but this time around after some close inspection, it looks like I sliced through the
dataset/train/29_103.wav|display ribbon extension ever so slightly with my pry tools as I was removing the back cover.
dataset/train/29_104.wav|Everything else is still working of course. The phone is still on and functional under the dark
dataset/train/29_105.wav|screen. It's just unfortunate that this 25 cent extension ribbon is what's keeping my
dataset/train/29_106.wav|screen from turning back on. Either way, it's a minor issue, still very fixable. I'll either
dataset/train/29_107.wav|repair this phone or use it for parts to repair other phones. Nothing goes to waste on my end.
dataset/train/29_108.wav|And there you have it, the S22 Ultra, watertight with no foresight on end-of-life. Is repair and
dataset/train/29_109.wav|recycling important to you? Let me know what you think down in the comments. And remember,
dataset/train/29_110.wav|your phone is infinitely less likely to die while installing a Teardown Skin
dataset/train/29_111.wav|than it would be if you took it apart. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/29_112.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/3_1.wav|We have reached the end of 2022, and it's been a pretty big year. We've accomplished quite a
dataset/train/3_2.wav|bit. The electric Hummer is officially rolling on its own power. The Whisper Project is far
dataset/train/3_3.wav|from over by the way. It's still definitely a work in progress and we have a long way to go
dataset/train/3_4.wav|before it's done. Our off-road wheelchair project kind of took priority this year.
dataset/train/3_5.wav|We got some new machines installed at the shop to help make off-road wheelchairs cheaper and
dataset/train/3_6.wav|better for those who need them. And the coolest machines we have I haven't even shown you yet.
dataset/train/3_7.wav|We got a sweet tour of Ford's new Lightning facility where they make the new electric
dataset/train/3_8.wav|Ford F-150s. And we also got to see a light bulb recycling facility where they can reclaim
dataset/train/3_9.wav|mercury found inside fluorescent bulbs. And another facility showed us how glass bottles
dataset/train/3_10.wav|are turned into insulation for residential homes. Absolutely fascinating process.
dataset/train/3_11.wav|One of the coolest things though, that has probably ever happened to me was seeing
dataset/train/3_12.wav|everyone come together to collect 34,000 books to stock the library we're building in Africa.
dataset/train/3_13.wav|The books should be arriving in Kenya very soon and I'll have an update for you as soon as that
dataset/train/3_14.wav|happens. And all of that is made possible of course because you come here to watch my videos,
dataset/train/3_15.wav|so thank you. And speaking of watching my videos, the phones this year were pretty decent. We had
dataset/train/3_16.wav|three phones break in 2021, and we had another three phones break here in 2022. And it's time
dataset/train/3_17.wav|to give out those durability awards. There were a few phones that I didn't get around to testing
dataset/train/3_18.wav|this year though - lucky for these phones. But also, lucky for you. I'm giving these away to some
dataset/train/3_19.wav|subscribers down in the comments of this video. Up here at the top we have the 2022 Motorola Razr,
dataset/train/3_20.wav|the folding one that I didn't get around to. We have a Nothing Phone, and iPhone 14 Pro
dataset/train/3_21.wav|Max....yup. I didn't get around to testing this one because the iPhone 14 Pro I felt like was
dataset/train/3_22.wav|the better phone. Either way, sealed in the box untested. We have some TCL's, some Vivos,
dataset/train/3_23.wav|and even this guy, Realme phone's down here. This guy's called the Unihertz Tank with a
dataset/train/3_24.wav|22,000 milliamp hour battery. I wish we'd had time to take this one apart. It has a standby
dataset/train/3_25.wav|of 100 days. Either way it is not my phone anymore. It is now going to be one of your
dataset/train/3_26.wav|phones because I'm picking some random people in the comments to DM and hand these off. So
dataset/train/3_27.wav|make sure you are subscribed and make sure you do leave a comment down there so I can find
dataset/train/3_28.wav|you. And make sure that you're very vigilant – there are still scams happening on YouTube. So
dataset/train/3_29.wav|if it doesn't have my name and a checkmark next to the username, it's not me and don't respond.
dataset/train/3_30.wav|Now let's begin. Let's start with the most repairable smartphone of 2022 from a screen repair
dataset/train/3_31.wav|perspective. And that award goes to the Pixel 7 Pro. With zero screws needed for the screen
dataset/train/3_32.wav|replacement, the whole thing can be done with a hot plate and a pry tool in about 60 seconds,
dataset/train/3_33.wav|and genuine replacement parts are easy to find across the internet, like over on ifixit.com.
dataset/train/3_34.wav|And as a runner up, and this might be rather surprising, but actually Apple has stepped
dataset/train/3_35.wav|up their repair game quite a bit with the iPhone 14- not the iPhone 14 Pro – just the
dataset/train/3_36.wav|regular iPhone 14, which now has a removable back glass and removable display. Apple's
dataset/train/3_37.wav|still being weird with the whole locking the whole locking the parts to the device thing,
dataset/train/3_38.wav|but as far as the physical repairability of the iPhone 14, it does win an honorary runner up. I
dataset/train/3_39.wav|do like the direction Apple is headed, but that doesn't mean we have to stop making fun of them.
dataset/train/3_40.wav|Now for the least repairable smartphone of 2022. You might be thinking to yourself
dataset/train/3_41.wav|that it's probably going to be one of the Folding Phones, like the Galaxy Fold 4. Or maybe even the
dataset/train/3_42.wav|Galaxy Flip 4. But as a matter of fact, I was able to completely disassemble the Flip 4 and
dataset/train/3_43.wav|put it all back together including the super soft Mohs 3 plastic screen in the center. So repairing
dataset/train/3_44.wav|it is possible. However, you are still correct because replacement parts are extremely difficult
dataset/train/3_45.wav|to find – non-existent. Samsung can repair it for you, $500 without insurance or $29 with insurance,
dataset/train/3_46.wav|but there is absolutely no fixing your phone on your own unless you harvest parts from a
dataset/train/3_47.wav|broken unit. So the folding phones, the Fold 4 and the Flip 4, do win the least repairable
dataset/train/3_48.wav|smartphone of 2022. But to be fair, it is a novelty device and people who are buying this
dataset/train/3_49.wav|smartphone do understand the risks – at least if they, you know, watch my videos they do.
dataset/train/3_50.wav|Now for the most innovative smartphone of 2022, and that has to go to the Nothing Phone. This
dataset/train/3_51.wav|guy right here with 972 LEDs on the back. We did count each and every one of them. And those 972
dataset/train/3_52.wav|LEDs do produce some exquisite illuminations on the back so it's definitely the most innovative
dataset/train/3_53.wav|smartphone of 2022. And while the internals might not be super unique or interesting,
dataset/train/3_54.wav|it would be pretty safe to say that nothing about any of these phones have really changed
dataset/train/3_55.wav|a lot in the last three years. In my opinion, innovation has been slightly lacking, so at
dataset/train/3_56.wav|least aesthetically we see something extremely new and extremely unique with the Nothing Phone.
dataset/train/3_57.wav|Which brings us to the best looking phone on the inside with, you know, the Nothing Phone
dataset/train/3_58.wav|does look pretty good with a semi-transparent back glass, but it's not necessarily showing
dataset/train/3_59.wav|off the internals. We do have the Xiaomi 12S with its massive 1 inch sensor which looked pretty cool
dataset/train/3_60.wav|from the inside. But if I had to pick just one, it would probably come back to the Pixel 7 Pro,
dataset/train/3_61.wav|with its pretty sweet looking wireless copper coils in the back and even the camera
dataset/train/3_62.wav|module is visible up here inside of the hump. The Pixel lineup is pretty much always coming
dataset/train/3_63.wav|out looking pretty fresh on the inside. Now let's go to the least durable smartphone of 2022, and
dataset/train/3_64.wav|that one was kind of hard to pick. I mean we do have the OnePlus Phones, the OnePlus 10 Pro which
dataset/train/3_65.wav|snapped in half. And then we have the OnePlus 10T, which also snapped in half in the exact
dataset/train/3_66.wav|same spot. But we also have another phone that broke easier, even easier than the new iPad,
dataset/train/3_67.wav|and that was the ROG Phone 6 Pro. And it snapped in half incredibly easily.
dataset/train/3_68.wav|The only thing that hurt worse than the sound of this snapping in half, was the sound of the
dataset/train/3_69.wav|price tag. At least the OnePlus Phones did provide some resistance. I can't say the same for the ROG
dataset/train/3_70.wav|Phone 6 Pro, so that is the phone that wins the least durable smartphone award of 2022.
dataset/train/3_71.wav|Now for the most durable smartphone, and that has to go, since we didn't review any sapphire
dataset/train/3_72.wav|Kyocera phones this year, that has to go to the AGM H5. It's actually one of the cheapest phones
dataset/train/3_73.wav|on the table. At $300 this rugged monster is also the world's loudest smartphone,
dataset/train/3_74.wav|with an IP68 waterproof rating and built in rubber bumpers around the outside that can withstand two
dataset/train/3_75.wav|meter drops onto concrete. This guy goes to show that durable phones don't have to be expensive.
dataset/train/3_76.wav|Which also means that any of these smartphones on the table could also be the most durable phone if
dataset/train/3_77.wav|they had a case. Personally, I always have a case on my phone. It's practical and saves money in the
dataset/train/3_78.wav|long run. My personal phone, the Note 10 Plus, probably would not have lasted its 3 ½ years
dataset/train/3_79.wav|without one. You can buy whatever you want, of course, but the case that I have on my phone is
dataset/train/3_80.wav|the grip case from dbrand. After 3 years of very hefty abuse, it's got some paint on the bottom,
dataset/train/3_81.wav|the Teardown Skin is a bit scratched up, and there is some separation near the bottom where
dataset/train/3_82.wav|I always pull it out of my pocket. But, I mean, for 3 ½ years it's held up very
dataset/train/3_83.wav|well and I use my phone far more than the average person. The price of this case factored out over,
dataset/train/3_84.wav|like, 3 years is 3 cents a day. Protection is always cheaper than the alternative.
dataset/train/3_85.wav|And you can quote me on that. Also, if your current phone is less than 3 years old,
dataset/train/3_86.wav|you're not missing much with these newcomers. I don't plan on upgrading my phone any time
dataset/train/3_87.wav|soon since my phone can still hold its own against anything else on this table.
dataset/train/3_88.wav|However, for people who are looking to upgrade, our work here is still very important since
dataset/train/3_89.wav|repairability and durability are two factors to consider when upgrading your smartphone. So our
dataset/train/3_90.wav|work here at JerryRigEverything continues. Hit that subscribe button. I do have some
dataset/train/3_91.wav|phones I need to get rid of down there in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram.
dataset/train/3_92.wav|And remember that everything we accomplish here on my channel, like building the library in Africa,
dataset/train/3_93.wav|and making inexpensive off-road wheelchairs for people happens because of you coming
dataset/train/3_94.wav|back here to watch my videos. So I know I say it a lot, but thank you.
dataset/train/3_95.wav|Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.
dataset/train/30_1.wav|Today in front of us we have the Red Magic 7. Red Magic was one of the gaming phones that survived
dataset/train/30_2.wav|my durability test last year. There were a few gaming phones that didn't. And this year I'm
dataset/train/30_3.wav|hoping this Red Magic 7 does survive. It has an internal RGB LED cooling fan and I want to see
dataset/train/30_4.wav|how it handles today's sponsor Mech Arena. Mech Arena is a free tactical team based mobile game
dataset/train/30_5.wav|that allows you to build and fight customizable mechs with a ton of upgradable weapons. Mech Arena
dataset/train/30_6.wav|also just launched a pilot's feature which brings 12 new drivers into the game, adding a ton of new
dataset/train/30_7.wav|strategies and tactics to the playing field. It's totally free to play. There are last man
dataset/train/30_8.wav|standing rounds, capture the flag style rounds, and you can play by yourself or with friends.
dataset/train/30_9.wav|There are dozens of mechs and plenty of weapons to build up a collection. Plus, personally,
dataset/train/30_10.wav|I like that it's one of those games you can play for a few minutes or a few hours depending on how
dataset/train/30_11.wav|much you want to upgrade your stuff. And, of course, it's free. Mech Arena has overhauled a
dataset/train/30_12.wav|few maps and always has special events happening around holidays. If you use my personal link down
dataset/train/30_13.wav|in the description, or scan this QR code you get a free steel reaper skin, 500 a-coins, and 70,000
dataset/train/30_14.wav|credits which will really help kick start your own game. My username in the game is JerryRig, so if
dataset/train/30_15.wav|you see me running around, play nice and remember it was me who got you all of that free coin.
dataset/train/30_16.wav|Now it's time to see if this Red Magic 7 can survive my durability test.
dataset/train/30_17.wav|Let's hope it does better than the OnePlus 10. Let's get started.
dataset/train/30_18.wav|Personally, I'm a big fan of gaming phones. They are allowed to be a little more flashy
dataset/train/30_19.wav|and usually have more top end specs than traditional non gaming phones.
dataset/train/30_20.wav|And while they are designed for gamers and gaming, regular people can still appreciate all that extra
dataset/train/30_21.wav|power. And everyone will notice the RGBs. Inside the box we get the phone, flexible rubber case,
dataset/train/30_22.wav|and Nubia's 65 watt fast charger with a USB-C cable. We're off to a good start.
dataset/train/30_23.wav|I also gotta say that this phone looks pretty awesome on the back. Red Magic has incorporated
dataset/train/30_24.wav|a clear glass panel over the cooling fan so we can see it in action. Transparent tech is the
dataset/train/30_25.wav|best tech. The clear panel also allows Nubia to highlight the other specs of the phone,
dataset/train/30_26.wav|all written below the surface, giving it more of a 3-dimensional vibe. I'm a fan of the fan.
dataset/train/30_27.wav|Red Magic has been doing the fan thing for a few years now
dataset/train/30_28.wav|but this is the first time they've ever had dual intakes which is 35%
dataset/train/30_29.wav|increased airflow over the singular vent from last year. And of course, not only do we have a clear
dataset/train/30_30.wav|fan, but it's also backlit by RGB LEDs. The lights aren't super pronounced on my well-lit desktop,
dataset/train/30_31.wav|but they're definitely there. I kind of wish they would rotate with the fan as it turns,
dataset/train/30_32.wav|kind of like the fans on desktop gaming PCs. But maybe that's a feature they'll add next year.
dataset/train/30_33.wav|Applying the flexible case I thought it was kind of dumb at first that the case blocked
dataset/train/30_34.wav|all intake and vents for the fan, but it turns out that the case in in fact not designed wrong,
dataset/train/30_35.wav|it just takes more than 3 brain cells to put it on correctly with the right side up.
dataset/train/30_36.wav|And of course the clear case does work with the fan just fine, not obstructing anything. You can
dataset/train/30_37.wav|see the RGB shining up through the fan vent. The phone does not have an official rating for obvious
dataset/train/30_38.wav|reasons, but let's see how much of a breeze this little fan can generate. When maxed out the thing
dataset/train/30_39.wav|spins at 20,000 rotations per minute. And while it's pretty quiet you can still definitely hear
dataset/train/30_40.wav|that something's going on inside. It's strong enough to blow the little paper strips around
dataset/train/30_41.wav|on my desk so it's definitely moving some major air over that processor and it'll be interesting
dataset/train/30_42.wav|to see what that duck work looks like from the inside during the teardown video...or,
dataset/train/30_43.wav|you know, if the phone snaps in half during this video, whichever comes first. And lucky
dataset/train/30_44.wav|for the fan, it is unreachable with my tweezers from the side vent, otherwise we'd poke it.
dataset/train/30_45.wav|Now for the scratch test. We've been performing these same series of tests on every major phone
dataset/train/30_46.wav|that's come out for the past 7 years. So we have a baseline for how durable a mobile device needs
dataset/train/30_47.wav|to be. It's nice of Red Magic to include a screen protector. We know that plastic scratches at level
dataset/train/30_48.wav|2 or 3. Glass is a 5 or 6. And sapphire is a level 8 or 9. The centerline camera bump
dataset/train/30_49.wav|on the back does allow the phone to rock back and forth during this process, and we find that
dataset/train/30_50.wav|the Red Magic 7 starts scratching at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. Pretty normal.
dataset/train/30_51.wav|The front 8 megapixel camera is tucked up into the top bezel along with the super thin
dataset/train/30_52.wav|plastic earpiece. The earpiece is secure though and won't be falling off on its own.
dataset/train/30_53.wav|The sides of the phone are made from metal. The capacitive triggers on each edge are scratchable.
dataset/train/30_54.wav|Red Magic says these buttons are good for over 2 million touches and have an 8 millisecond response
dataset/train/30_55.wav|time which is almost as fast as the display refreshes. So if your chicken dinner gets yeeted
dataset/train/30_56.wav|by a Smurf, you can't go blaming the hardware. And your eyes also don't deceive you, there is indeed
dataset/train/30_57.wav|a headphone jack at the top. And over on the left side we have a dedicated gaming mode button,
dataset/train/30_58.wav|along with the fan intake and metal volume rocker. The bottom has our lower stereo speaker, 65 watt
dataset/train/30_59.wav|USB-C port, and our dual SIM card tray with a red rubber ring. There is some water resistance.
dataset/train/30_60.wav|The back of the phone, as we see, is covered with glass. The center strip has a metallic shine to
dataset/train/30_61.wav|it and the rest of the glass slab is transparent so we can see through onto the designs under the
dataset/train/30_62.wav|glass panel. The camera lenses are also covered by glass. The top is an 8 megapixel ultrawide and
dataset/train/30_63.wav|then we have the 64 megapixel main sensor, and at the bottom we have a 2 megapixel macro camera,
dataset/train/30_64.wav|all above a triangular single color LED flash. The rear intake for the air duct
dataset/train/30_65.wav|is made from metal. I'm very curious to see how it all connects on the inside.
dataset/train/30_66.wav|But one interesting feature that I haven't seen before is that the Red Magic has their fingerprint
dataset/train/30_67.wav|scanner doing double duty as a heart rate monitor. I wonder if other phones could implement this as
dataset/train/30_68.wav|well with a software update since it's a pretty cool feature. Coming back to the fans,
dataset/train/30_69.wav|it's easy to tell what direction the air is going because of the way the vent sucks the flame from
dataset/train/30_70.wav|my lighter inside the phone. Red Magic is saying that in addition to the fan there are nine layers
dataset/train/30_71.wav|of heat dissipating material inside, which is, once again all the more reason to take it apart.
dataset/train/30_72.wav|The screen is a 6.8 inch 1080p with a 165 hertz refresh rate and a 720 hertz touch sample rate,
dataset/train/30_73.wav|meaning the phone can sense your touch before you can even see it on the screen. It also has a 10
dataset/train/30_74.wav|bit AMOLED with 1 billion colors and lasts for about 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter
dataset/train/30_75.wav|before the screen starts to burn white. And that mark does stay there permanently.
dataset/train/30_76.wav|We'll test the fingerprint scanner real quick before the
dataset/train/30_77.wav|bend test. Adding some level 7 deeper grooves after my print has been set,
dataset/train/30_78.wav|and even with those extra abrasions on top, the optical reader is still surprisingly quick.
dataset/train/30_79.wav|Normally my fingers don't have good luck with fingerprint readers. And speaking of luck,
dataset/train/30_80.wav|for some reason phones aren't having good luck with my bend test this year. So fingers crossed
dataset/train/30_81.wav|that the air channels inside of this Red Magic 7 don't make anything weaker inside.
dataset/train/30_82.wav|Bending from the back with the fan full blast, we do get a slight flex but no cracking sounds
dataset/train/30_83.wav|or other indications of failure. And flipping it around to the front again yields no
dataset/train/30_84.wav|structural damage. The Red Magic has made a solid structural and very interesting phone for 2022.
dataset/train/30_85.wav|It does survive my durability test meaning we can move forward to taking it apart for the teardown.
dataset/train/30_86.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already so you don't miss that video.
dataset/train/30_87.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/31_1.wav|If you recognize Trogdor, you're an internet OG. The Galaxy S22 Ultra with a massive
dataset/train/31_2.wav|S on the box, for dragon, is here, with a box made of recycled packaging. Pretty cool.
dataset/train/31_3.wav|Nice work, Samsung. Today we're going to find out how durable this matte black S22 Ultra is
dataset/train/31_4.wav|and how well it can stand up to everyday life. Inside the box we get the phone
dataset/train/31_5.wav|and a USB-C charging cable, and that's about it. Right off the bat I do have to say I'm a fan
dataset/train/31_6.wav|of these individualized camera bumps, but we'll get to that more in a second. Let's get started.
dataset/train/31_7.wav|Samsung has combined their Note line and S line of phones into one and I'm definitely
dataset/train/31_8.wav|okay with that. The phones were basically the same anyway minus the s-pen so it just makes sense.
dataset/train/31_9.wav|Let's start with the scratch test. Samsung says they are running Gorilla Glass
dataset/train/31_10.wav|Victus on the front and back of the phone. There doesn't appear to be
dataset/train/31_11.wav|any plastic screen protectors installed. Those would scratch at a level 2 or 3,
dataset/train/31_12.wav|while tempered glass scratches at a 5 or 6, and sapphire would scratch at a level 8 or 9. We
dataset/train/31_13.wav|do get some rockage with all the cameras being on one side, but that's not too big of a deal.
dataset/train/31_14.wav|We see the screen start scratching at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. So far so good.
dataset/train/31_15.wav|Also, on camera you'll notice this super weird flashing of the display. I think that's the super
dataset/train/31_16.wav|low refresh rate Samsung is talking about, but it does not show up in real life to the naked eye.
dataset/train/31_17.wav|Speaking of eyes, cyclops up here in the center is a 40 megapixel selfie camera, along with very
dataset/train/31_18.wav|minimal bezels and an earpiece slit about the thickness of a human hair. And as per usual,
dataset/train/31_19.wav|Samsung has included the typical micro plastic protection on all sides of the phone. They should
dataset/train/31_20.wav|probably stop doing this. The phone is made from metal and it'll last just fine in a cardboard box.
dataset/train/31_21.wav|The buttons are also made from metal and still also removable, so if you find someone with the
dataset/train/31_22.wav|same phone as you but a different color, you can swap buttons and be best friends forever.
dataset/train/31_23.wav|The top has more of this dumb plastic,
dataset/train/31_24.wav|along with the other side of the phone. If I really wanted this much Saran Wrap, Samsung,
dataset/train/31_25.wav|I'd check my grandma's fridge for the leftovers.
dataset/train/31_26.wav|Down at the bottom we have more micro plastics, along with 45 watt fast charging USB-C port
dataset/train/31_27.wav|and the new s-pen hijacked from that no lineup. We also have a singular SIM card tray with no
dataset/train/31_28.wav|expandable memory. Now, I've been a huge fan of the Note lineup for its whole existence, so
dataset/train/31_29.wav|I'm glad it's continuing in spirit through the S22 Ultras. I honestly don't use the s-pen very often,
dataset/train/31_30.wav|but I like having tools on hand if I ever do need them. This time around Samsung has improved the
dataset/train/31_31.wav|response time of the pen from the last Note taking it from 9 milliseconds down to 2.8. Response time
dataset/train/31_32.wav|is always very important. The s-pen itself seems to have about the same construction as it usually
dataset/train/31_33.wav|does. The tip doesn't seem to want to come out though so maybe those aren't replaceable this
dataset/train/31_34.wav|year. It is watertight though so it'll be fun to see how they accomplish that from the inside.
dataset/train/31_35.wav|Slicing it open so we can get a good look. It's sealed pretty good with the black plastic all
dataset/train/31_36.wav|around the exterior. Once we get in we see the copper coils around the shaft that let the phone
dataset/train/31_37.wav|wirelessly detect the s-pen's presence, as well as the pressure sensitive tip
dataset/train/31_38.wav|that can detect 4096 different pressure levels, along with a rubber ring. We should have known.
dataset/train/31_39.wav|When in doubt, throw on some rubber, it usually does a pretty good job of waterproofing.
dataset/train/31_40.wav|The back half of the shaft is also encased in plastic. And once again we see a capacitor
dataset/train/31_41.wav|inside instead of a battery. The capacitor is what allows the s-pen to hold power while it's
dataset/train/31_42.wav|away from the phone so it can do it's clicky takey pictures thing. There's also a ton of glue in here
dataset/train/31_43.wav|to keep moisture off the circuits. Pretty cool. Thumbs up if you like seeing the insides of stuff.
dataset/train/31_44.wav|The phone does want its s-pen back inside, which is unfortunate. Not sure how I'm
dataset/train/31_45.wav|going to explain that the pen is not in fact somewhere safe, but let's continue.
dataset/train/31_46.wav|The back of the S22 Ultra is matte black and has a smooth frosted surface. Camera-wise up at the
dataset/train/31_47.wav|top we have a series of 5 mirrored lens rings. A 12 megapixel ultra wide in the corner, then a 108
dataset/train/31_48.wav|megapixel camera below that, and a 10 megapixel 10x optical zoom periscope camera at the bottom.
dataset/train/31_49.wav|On the right side we have a normal 3x 10 megapixel telephoto with a glass covered flash, and the
dataset/train/31_50.wav|laser auto focus circle up top. I'm kind of a big fan of this design. It's minimalist without any
dataset/train/31_51.wav|rectangular excess, and each of the sides of the little circle bits are encompassed with a
dataset/train/31_52.wav|metallic mirrored metal. Speaking of encompassing, if you're looking to differentiate your rectangle
dataset/train/31_53.wav|from all the other rectangles out there, there's always dbrand's leather skins. Channel sponsor
dataset/train/31_54.wav|dbrand has always taken skinning your phone quite literally this time with 100% real full grain
dataset/train/31_55.wav|leather. Hide fine enough to make even your wallet jealous. Now it's possible to look all outdoorsy
dataset/train/31_56.wav|and stuff without ever leaving the house. So if you've ever wanted your phone to smell like
dataset/train/31_57.wav|a high end shoe store, I'll leave a link down in the description. It comes in black, brown,
dataset/train/31_58.wav|or tan to match whatever rodeo cowboy cosplay you got going, and even breaks in over time,
dataset/train/31_59.wav|just like a nice pair of boots...which are those things people wear when going outside. I'm sure
dataset/train/31_60.wav|the next thing we'll see from dbrand is a skin made out of broccoli so we can appease the vegans.
dataset/train/31_61.wav|The screen of the S22 Ultra is pretty interesting. It has a variable refresh rate
dataset/train/31_62.wav|which is why sometimes it looks screwy on camera. Human eyes don't see the refresh rate fluctuating,
dataset/train/31_63.wav|but my camera can capture it moving from 1 hertz on still images to 120 hertz while scrolling.
dataset/train/31_64.wav|One hundred and twenty hertz is super useful for getting that microscopic hit of diluted dopamine
dataset/train/31_65.wav|milliseconds faster. The 6.8 inch 1440p dynamic AMOLED display lasted 20 seconds under the heat
dataset/train/31_66.wav|from my lighter before going white with a permanent little on screen blemish.
dataset/train/31_67.wav|Lastly, before the bend test, we have an underscreen ultrasonic fingerprint reader.
dataset/train/31_68.wav|Instead of optically seeing a fingerprint, it uses an ultrasonic pulse to bounce
dataset/train/31_69.wav|waves off of the ridges of my digit. And after adding extensive level 7 deeper grooves on top,
dataset/train/31_70.wav|it does appear to still be functioning just fine. So scratches don't deter the waves.
dataset/train/31_71.wav|Finally, we have the bend test. While most phones survive, some do not, like the OnePlus 10 Pro,
dataset/train/31_72.wav|which means we do have to test them all. Samsung has pretty much always had some
dataset/train/31_73.wav|really solid devices. We don't need to bring up the Note 7 though because that would be rude.
dataset/train/31_74.wav|When bent from the back consistent with history, this S22 Ultra is as solid as they come. Same
dataset/train/31_75.wav|thing when we flip it over to the front – solid as a rock. Now you're probably asking yourself, 'Hey
dataset/train/31_76.wav|Jerry, are you going to upgrade your two and a half year old Note 10 Plus to this new S22 Ultra?'
dataset/train/31_77.wav|And the answer is no, no I will not. My current phone still works really great. You don't need
dataset/train/31_78.wav|the latest processor or the highest resolution to doomsday scroll yourself into crippling depression
dataset/train/31_79.wav|over current world events. Older processors can handle that just fine. There's no reason to be sad
dataset/train/31_80.wav|and poor when you can just be sad. If my current phone was broken I would consider the S22 Ultra
dataset/train/31_81.wav|as a replacement, but my phone is not broken and works just fine. Plus we still need to see
dataset/train/31_82.wav|if Samsung has made their batteries easier to recycle before I ever pick up a Samsung as my
dataset/train/31_83.wav|daily driver again, but I'll cover more of that in the teardown. Until then, nice work, Samsung.
dataset/train/31_84.wav|The S22 Ultra passes my durability test. Do you like the new camera layout? Let me know down in
dataset/train/31_85.wav|the comments. Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss when we take this guy apart. And
dataset/train/31_86.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/32_1.wav|The OnePlus 10 Pro. Now normally OnePlus releases their phone to everyone at the same time,
dataset/train/32_2.wav|but this year that's not the case. This phone is not available here in the United States.
dataset/train/32_3.wav|Makes you wonder if something's up. So today we're going to durability test this OnePlus
dataset/train/32_4.wav|phone to see if there's anything we need to find out. And even though this is not a Hummer video,
dataset/train/32_5.wav|we do have Hummer shirts in stock with The Whisper Project right here on the
dataset/train/32_6.wav|front and all of the specs from my custom military Humvee turned electric on the back.
dataset/train/32_7.wav|A few people have asked why my shirts are so inexpensive and that's because I don't use a third
dataset/train/32_8.wav|party middleman to ship my stuff. I do everything myself right here from home using today's sponsor
dataset/train/32_9.wav|Stamps.com. Stamps.com has been around for 20 years helping over a million businesses,
dataset/train/32_10.wav|like my own, get the best rates for shipping. Using Stamps.com I can get up to 40% off of USPS,
dataset/train/32_11.wav|and 76% off of UPS. Those are massive discounts. Plus no trips to the post office, no traffic,
dataset/train/32_12.wav|no standing in lines, cuz time is money and Stamps.com saves me time, money, and stress by
dataset/train/32_13.wav|allowing me to do everything right here. And it's a win for everyone because I can take the savings
dataset/train/32_14.wav|I get from Stamps.com and pass them on directly to you, making my stuff less expensive. If you want
dataset/train/32_15.wav|to start shipping your stuff for less money, head to Stamps.com/JerryRig for a special offer – free

dataset/train/32_19.wav|You can find the links for Stamps.com/JerryRig down in the description, and I'll get to shipping
dataset/train/32_20.wav|your shirt right after we finish with this durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/32_21.wav|So I just want to start this one off by saying I have never had a OnePlus phone snap in half.
dataset/train/32_22.wav|We've had one break, yes, but it's relatively rare actually for any smartphone to fail
dataset/train/32_23.wav|my durability test. Out of the hundreds of phones that go through this routine,
dataset/train/32_24.wav|only seldom do we have one expeditiously expire. That being said,
dataset/train/32_25.wav|OnePlus has included a charging brick in the box which is nice, along with a flexible case.
dataset/train/32_26.wav|- Probably not going to help.
dataset/train/32_27.wav|-Dude, let them watch. Personally, I think the phone itself looks pretty good actually.
dataset/train/32_28.wav|It's got the textured back glass with a hint of sparkle, like an 'I focus at work but party
dataset/train/32_29.wav|on the weekends' kind of vibe. Upon close inspection, there does appear to be a screen
dataset/train/32_30.wav|protector included on the front, which is nice. Any protection is good protection.
dataset/train/32_31.wav|However, and I've never had this happen before, there is a very distinct smell
dataset/train/32_32.wav|coming from the protector. Almost like some very strong hairspray...not
dataset/train/32_33.wav|that I have much experience hairspray, but it is super strange. If I hold it up to the camera
dataset/train/32_34.wav|you might be able to get a whiff... Oh, no? I guess we'll just have to wait for the metaverse.
dataset/train/32_35.wav|Let's start with the scratch test. Back in 1822 a super smart guy named Friedrich Mohs
dataset/train/32_36.wav|invented this cool test to see what different smartphone screens are made from. It can,
dataset/train/32_37.wav|of course, also be used to differentiate between different minerals, but man, that guy was ahead
dataset/train/32_38.wav|of his time. Plastic is a level 2 or 3. Glass is a 5 or 6, and sapphire would be an 8 or 9.
dataset/train/32_39.wav|You might have noticed as well that there are a lot of apps and warnings on this phone in
dataset/train/32_40.wav|Chinese, and that's because OnePlus has decided to not release this phone in the USA. This is a
dataset/train/32_41.wav|foreign model, and as you can see does scratch at a level 6 with deeper groves at a level 7.
dataset/train/32_42.wav|The front facing hole punch camera is chilling under that same slab of glass,
dataset/train/32_43.wav|it's 32 megapixels. The earpiece lid is up here as well with no grill. The size of
dataset/train/32_44.wav|the OnePlus 10 Pro are made from aluminum. It's interesting that if we switch OnePlus' numerical
dataset/train/32_45.wav|numbering system to a base two binary. Instead of OnePlus 10 we get OnePlus 2,
dataset/train/32_46.wav|which is the first OnePlus phone I ever tested seven years ago. We've come full circle.
dataset/train/32_47.wav|Looks like every side and button of this OnePlus 2 is made from metal.
dataset/train/32_48.wav|The dual SIM card tray has its red rubber ring around the opening to help keep water out.
dataset/train/32_49.wav|Even though there is no official IP rating, it's good to know that the protection is there.
dataset/train/32_50.wav|The back of the phone does have a seam next to the camera lens where the metal frame
dataset/train/32_51.wav|joins up to the glass. And then, of course, we have the heavily textured back glass panel,
dataset/train/32_52.wav|which once again is using its level 6 texture to sand down my level 5 steel razor blade. The dust
dataset/train/32_53.wav|can mostly be rubbed off though so it's not a big deal. I think the textured glass is pretty cool.
dataset/train/32_54.wav|The cameras on this phone is where Hasselblad comes in with their color calibration. Apparently
dataset/train/32_55.wav|this main 50 megapixel camera can support 12 bit raw images, which is a pretty big deal on paper.
dataset/train/32_56.wav|I'll let other reviewers handle the image quality, I'm just here for the durability.
dataset/train/32_57.wav|And it looks like the other two cameras, the 8 megapixel telephoto and 48 megapixel wide angle
dataset/train/32_58.wav|are protected with glass as well. The ring flash also has its own glass lens, dual tone with both
dataset/train/32_59.wav|LEDs at the bottom. And kind of a light bar effect up at the top. No complaints so far.
dataset/train/32_60.wav|The display of the OnePlus 10 Pro is also one of the main selling points of the phone.
dataset/train/32_61.wav|Most screens these days are unable to show those billions of colors collected by the rear
dataset/train/32_62.wav|Hasselblad cameras. But the display on this OnePlus 10 Pro is 10-bit, which means it can
dataset/train/32_63.wav|handle at least a billion of those shades that the camera can't collect. Plus the 6.7 inch 120
dataset/train/32_64.wav|Hertz 1440p display can last for about 40 seconds under the heat from my lighter before it gets
dataset/train/32_65.wav|toasted and does not recover. As I'm setting up my fingerprint you can see a permanent little gold
dataset/train/32_66.wav|mark in the corner of the screen. Hopefully though that's all the damage this guy will sustain.
dataset/train/32_67.wav|- This is called foreshadowing.
dataset/train/32_68.wav|-Silence.
dataset/train/32_69.wav|With the fingerprint registered, we can add some level 7 deeper grooves
dataset/train/32_70.wav|to the bottom half of the screen, right above that optical reader.
dataset/train/32_71.wav|Even with that hefty marring though the fingerprint reader is still able to find my
dataset/train/32_72.wav|print and unlock the phone every single time. Nice work on that scanner OnePlus. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/32_73.wav|However, it's time to assess the structural integrity of the phone as a whole
dataset/train/32_74.wav|as I always do with a bend test. If you ever hear
dataset/train/32_75.wav|noises during this portion of the video it's usually a bad thing.
dataset/train/32_76.wav|And none of those were good noises. The Volcanic Black Frosted back has been
dataset/train/32_77.wav|thoroughly cracked. The cracks consolidate into what looks like a line directly underneath the
dataset/train/32_78.wav|stove top camera bump. I don't think it's the frosted glass that's what's making this
dataset/train/32_79.wav|phone weaker though since we've had plenty of frosted glass textured glass phones survive
dataset/train/32_80.wav|and they survive in one piece instead of millions. I think it's something else. The
dataset/train/32_81.wav|phone is still alive though, which is good. Let's bend the OnePlus 10 Pro from the other direction.
dataset/train/32_82.wav|And now, except for the flashlight, the OnePlus 10 Pro is definitely not alive anymore. I would
dataset/train/32_83.wav|say though that this flash does appear to be rather exceptional. It's a little unnerving
dataset/train/32_84.wav|that we are only two phones into 2022 and we've already lost one. And the one phone that has
dataset/train/32_85.wav|survived so far this year is a folding phone. Well I guess technically they are both folding
dataset/train/32_86.wav|phones now since the OnePlus 10 has a nice crease right under that camera lens. But normally most
dataset/train/32_87.wav|phones cannot be cracked in half with bare human hands. So let's see why this one can.
dataset/train/32_88.wav|Removing the back panel is easier now that we aren't worried about it breaking...anymore
dataset/train/32_89.wav|than it already is of course. It's kind of fun we can combine the teardown and the durability
dataset/train/32_90.wav|test into the same video, and you know, I'm not a structural engineer, but it
dataset/train/32_91.wav|appears to me that the lack of structure is what contributed to the rapid unplanned disassembly.
dataset/train/32_92.wav|The large dual cell 5000 milliamp hour battery runs lengthwise across the whole phone,
dataset/train/32_93.wav|leaving just the side rails to take the force of any human accidentally sitting on it.
dataset/train/32_94.wav|Maybe that's why it's not being released in the USA. OnePlus thinks that Americans are too fat
dataset/train/32_95.wav|for this phone. And while they aren't wrong, it is a little rude. It also doesn't help that
dataset/train/32_96.wav|the volume button is placed where it removes some structure at that exact breaking point,
dataset/train/32_97.wav|above the battery on the right side. And on the left side there is an antenna line
dataset/train/32_98.wav|along with a much thinner metal exterior than I expected. The metal exterior shell isn't doing
dataset/train/32_99.wav|a whole lot to hold the phone together. And, you know, don't get me wrong, if the OnePlus 10 Pro
dataset/train/32_100.wav|stays in a front pocket, it'll last just fine for it's three to seven year lifespan. But in a back
dataset/train/32_101.wav|pocket or any abnormal abuse could very well cause the 10 Pro to kick the bucket much sooner than it
dataset/train/32_102.wav|should. Durability is one of the many factors to consider when buying a phone. Like always though,
dataset/train/32_103.wav|one broken phone doesn't make a brand bad forever. OnePlus can pick up the pieces and come back with
dataset/train/32_104.wav|a more solid phone next year. A simple rigid case will always help add structure where there is
dataset/train/32_105.wav|none. I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skins and grip case down in the description. It's definitely
dataset/train/32_106.wav|too late to protect my unit though. Protection is more preemptive and not so good retroactively.
dataset/train/32_107.wav|Does the phone snapping in half affect your buying decisions? Let me know down in the comments. I'm
dataset/train/32_108.wav|off to go ship some shirts with Stamps.com. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/32_109.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/33_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart the Oppo Find N Folding smartphone. Oppo has said there are
dataset/train/33_2.wav|136 different components inside of this hinge, all with their own extreme tolerances of 0.01
dataset/train/33_3.wav|millimeters. So today we're going to take this apart and see if we can find all 136...which
dataset/train/33_4.wav|means this teardown is probably going to be pretty destructive. Speaking of destructive though,
dataset/train/33_5.wav|you know Audible is a sponsor of my channel and over the summer I listened to an audio book
dataset/train/33_6.wav|called Project Hail Mary that I'm still thinking about. It's written by the same guy who wrote
dataset/train/33_7.wav|The Martian. Project Hail Mary is about a guy who goes to space to save our planet from destruction.
dataset/train/33_8.wav|So if you enjoy space, cool science, and jerry-rigging everything, I think you'll
dataset/train/33_9.wav|enjoy Project Hail Mary as well. It's probably one of my most favorite novels of all time. You
dataset/train/33_10.wav|can get this audio book for free along with a 30-day trial using my link audible.com/jerryrig.
dataset/train/33_11.wav|Plus you'll get full access to the Audible Plus catalog with podcasts, Audible Originals,
dataset/train/33_12.wav|guided fitness programs and tons of other stuff with new titles being added all the time.
dataset/train/33_13.wav|When you download the Audible app though, don't forget about Project Hail Mary because it's pretty
dataset/train/33_14.wav|awesome. And rumor on the street is it's being made into a movie and the best time to listen
dataset/train/33_15.wav|to an audio book is before the movie comes out so we can all complain about the movie together.
dataset/train/33_16.wav|Audible.com/jerryrig for your free audio book, 30 day trial, and you keep getting a free audio book
dataset/train/33_17.wav|with every month of your subscription. You can cancel whenever you want. Huge thanks to Audible
dataset/train/33_18.wav|for sponsoring this video and sponsoring the channel. They are the best. Now it's time to see
dataset/train/33_19.wav|if this hinge really does have 136 component inside. Let's get started.
dataset/train/33_20.wav|Normally I like to be gentle when taking apart a smartphone with the hopes that I can assemble it
dataset/train/33_21.wav|back together in one piece and have it all still work. This teardown though is not going to be one
dataset/train/33_22.wav|of those gentle dis-assemblies. We have a lot of things to find out, none of which allow this
dataset/train/33_23.wav|phone to live. We know that smartphone screens are usually pretty fragile, even more so when encased
dataset/train/33_24.wav|in a thin sheet of plastic instead of hardened glass. Oppo has included black plastic bumpers
dataset/train/33_25.wav|around the edge of the screen like we've seen on the Galaxy Folds. I imagine this helps keep
dataset/train/33_26.wav|the pressure off the screen as well as keep a relatively tight seal around the edge so that
dataset/train/33_27.wav|dust and drops of liquid stay out. But mostly I think the bumpers are here to protect the super
dataset/train/33_28.wav|fragile edge of the screen since that is where it has the least amount of protection. And one simple
dataset/train/33_29.wav|poke in the wrong spot kills the whole screen immediately, effectively, and permanently. The
dataset/train/33_30.wav|exterior screen is still alive but that one tiny poke on the inner screen sent the flexible display
dataset/train/33_31.wav|to swim with the fishes. Fine with me though. Now that it's toast we can be a whole lot less gentle.
dataset/train/33_32.wav|The coolest thing that we can see while ripping off the screen
dataset/train/33_33.wav|is the rubberized metal mesh that helps add structure to the bendy bits. Super flexible
dataset/train/33_34.wav|and elastic with a breaking and ripping point far beyond whatever experience with normal use.
dataset/train/33_35.wav|Gonna be honest...looks way cool.
dataset/train/33_36.wav|We'll unplug this green ribbon later. Oppo says that the display of the Find N is made
dataset/train/33_37.wav|up of 12 different layers. The only one we're interested in at the moment though is the ultra
dataset/train/33_38.wav|thin glass layer, similar to Samsung. Oppo touts this glass layer as a benefit to structure,
dataset/train/33_39.wav|durability, and overall feel of the screen. That's open to debate, but we can still find it.
dataset/train/33_40.wav|On top we have the transparent permanent screen protector. No glass here.
dataset/train/33_41.wav|But under that, attached to the tempted polarizer, I think we have it,
dataset/train/33_42.wav|the flexible UTG. Getting up close and personal with what's left of this layer
dataset/train/33_43.wav|we can see that it bends well enough but if the radius gets too tight you can hear and see the
dataset/train/33_44.wav|thin layer of glass crack. Oppo has done a good job of making the curve of the Find N
dataset/train/33_45.wav|pretty gentle. They say it's an 80% reduction over the crease we see in the Fold 3 or Galaxy Flip.
dataset/train/33_46.wav|The gentler the curve the easier it is on the display and the glass. Very interesting tech.
dataset/train/33_47.wav|I don't doubt that there are 12 layers of screen inside of this thing,
dataset/train/33_48.wav|especially if they are counting the metal backing, the screen, the rubber, and glue
dataset/train/33_49.wav|holding everything together. There's a lot going on in here. Going back to the phone itself,
dataset/train/33_50.wav|there's no easy way to access the guts from this side. In order to do that and expose the hinge,
dataset/train/33_51.wav|we'll need to enter from the other side. The phone is still alive at the moment,
dataset/train/33_52.wav|but probably not for much longer. This dissection runs straight through the middle.
dataset/train/33_53.wav|The only downside to having textured glass on the rear exterior panel
dataset/train/33_54.wav|is that my suction cup now does not have a smooth surface to grip onto
dataset/train/33_55.wav|when trying to lift up. It makes slicing away the adhesive rather difficult. Today though, that
dataset/train/33_56.wav|doesn't really matter. Apparently no part of this phone is getting out alive. The textured glass
dataset/train/33_57.wav|breaks just like the ultra thin glass and glass in general. Glass is glass, and glass breaks.
dataset/train/33_58.wav|Finally, the glass is removed with only minor subdermal incursions. There are a total of 28
dataset/train/33_59.wav|screws holding down the components in this half of the Find N. The coolest thing though is underneath
dataset/train/33_60.wav|this wireless charger and silver bracket. It's how Oppo has decided to add water and dust
dataset/train/33_61.wav|resistance to their hinge. While this thing, of course, doesn't have an official IP rating, this
dataset/train/33_62.wav|blue rubber behemoth indicates a decent amount of ingress protection. I'll pop off the top plastics
dataset/train/33_63.wav|and wireless charger to get to the second silver bracket. These cover up the ribbons that traverse
dataset/train/33_64.wav|between the halves of the phone. And once again we find lots of rubber filling up the whole hole.
dataset/train/33_65.wav|It's not the caulking that Samsung is using but rubber stoppers still do offer good protection.
dataset/train/33_66.wav|Underneath all the Lego-style connectors are additional rubber gaskets. A lot of times when
dataset/train/33_67.wav|devices get water damaged it's because these pins get wet and shorted out or corroded by liquid,
dataset/train/33_68.wav|so it's nice that each of these plugs has it's own layer of protection. Of course,
dataset/train/33_69.wav|I still wouldn't take your Find N swimming. You'll probably be finding out it's dead afterwards,
dataset/train/33_70.wav|but it's good that the splash protection is there. The camera module comes out easy enough.
dataset/train/33_71.wav|It's probably one of the only parts of this phone that will survive.
dataset/train/33_72.wav|The top lens is a 13 megapixel telephoto with no OIS. The main 50 megapixel main sensor in
dataset/train/33_73.wav|the middle does have OIS. And the 16 megapixel ultrawide camera at the bottom does not have OIS.
dataset/train/33_74.wav|The loudspeaker comes out next. It does have the waterproof screen over the opening
dataset/train/33_75.wav|which is more good news for the overall water resistance. It also has a little black sticker
dataset/train/33_76.wav|protecting the balls inside. The foam balls inside the speaker provide more surface area
dataset/train/33_77.wav|for the sound to reverberate off of so the speaker can sound bigger than it actually is.
dataset/train/33_78.wav|The charging port itself is on its own ribbon with a red rubber ring around the opening.
dataset/train/33_79.wav|The vibrator motor is one of the rectangular boys, and lucky for us the battery has a pull
dataset/train/33_80.wav|tab. Batteries that come out easy are the best. This guy is a 2085 milliamp hour.
dataset/train/33_81.wav|And right now in 2022, lithium batteries are 95% recyclable, but they can only be recycled
dataset/train/33_82.wav|if they are easy to remove. So nice work Oppo for making that possible with this Find N.
dataset/train/33_83.wav|There's one more screw holding down the motherboard. And when that's removed the
dataset/train/33_84.wav|board is free from the phone. It's double stacked and looks pretty sweet with it's blue accents.
dataset/train/33_85.wav|And that's it for this half of the phone. In order to separate this wing from the hinge,
dataset/train/33_86.wav|there's a few more screws and the halves can pull apart.
dataset/train/33_87.wav|The ribbons pull through the side of the phone so that they can stay with the hinge.
dataset/train/33_88.wav|We'll get a close up look at that in a second. We have some counting to do if we want to find 136
dataset/train/33_89.wav|components. I'll heat up the smaller front screen so that hopefully it will come off in one piece
dataset/train/33_90.wav|instead of shattering everywhere like the rear panel did. Safety glasses on. This
dataset/train/33_91.wav|time since we can use a suction cup, things should go a lot smoother and indeed it does.
dataset/train/33_92.wav|Once the two more screws holding down the ribbon to the motherboard are removed, the screen is free
dataset/train/33_93.wav|from the phone. This side of the phone is very similar to the other side so we'll speed run
dataset/train/33_94.wav|through it in order to get to that hinge. There are another 21 inch screws surrounding this half,
dataset/train/33_95.wav|along with another loud speaker, which also has waterproofing mesh around the opening,
dataset/train/33_96.wav|and has balls of its own. SIM card comes out, Legos get unplugged. This side also has the same
dataset/train/33_97.wav|massive rubber stoppers plugging up the ribbon channel holes through the hinge. And the battery
dataset/train/33_98.wav|is easy to remove. Thumbs up for that. It brings our total milliamp hour count to 4500.
dataset/train/33_99.wav|And once again, one more screw holds down the motherboard.
dataset/train/33_100.wav|It's amazing how many parts have to fit so perfectly together to make folding phones work.
dataset/train/33_101.wav|The engineering that goes into this thing is mind-boggling.
dataset/train/33_102.wav|With the ribbons loosened and the screws removed, we can pull the hinge away from this half of
dataset/train/33_103.wav|the phone, leaving us with a mechanism that controls it all. With apparently 136 components
dataset/train/33_104.wav|in this sliver of spine. It's not that I doubt Oppo about their counting skills but it's still
dataset/train/33_105.wav|good to double check. Plus we can see how it works as we go. Let's start with the screws.
dataset/train/33_106.wav|Ready. Count with me now. One. Two. Three. For some reason I don't hear you counting.
dataset/train/33_107.wav|There's only 133 objects left to find and we need to do this together. Teamwork. Apparently
dataset/train/33_108.wav|each of these screws have a little washer bracket thing
dataset/train/33_109.wav|that's attached under them as well, which I'm sure Oppo is including in their component numbers.
dataset/train/33_110.wav|This screw should be number 11 and the washer would be number 12. I have a feeling that counting
dataset/train/33_111.wav|every little component might be harder than we think. I'm sure we can still get close though.
dataset/train/33_112.wav|With all the screws removed, that exterior visible designed by fine spine can be removed.
dataset/train/33_113.wav|This guy is just one solid piece of metal that traverses the length of the phone. Since it's only
dataset/train/33_114.wav|one part we'll just count it as one. But including the ribbons we are now up to about 22 items.
dataset/train/33_115.wav|It looks like the rest of the hinge is divided into very three similar, yet separate, springed
dataset/train/33_116.wav|mechanisms, each with their own sprints, each with their own set of gears. And I don't doubt
dataset/train/33_117.wav|in the slightest that there are at least 30-40 individual parts in each of these sections.
dataset/train/33_118.wav|This thing is an impressive work of art and Oppo was definitely not padding their marketing by
dataset/train/33_119.wav|saying there's 136 components in here. After seeing it up close, I'm sure they all exist.
dataset/train/33_120.wav|This bad boy is far more complex than your average door hinge, and it's fun to see what
dataset/train/33_121.wav|allows this phone to open and close an estimated 200,000 times without failure. Nice work, Oppo.
dataset/train/33_122.wav|I'm not sure which part is cooler though, the flexible screen or the hinge that makes
dataset/train/33_123.wav|it all happen. What do you think? Let me know down in the comments. Remember your
dataset/train/33_124.wav|free audio book is down in the description right next to the link for my Jerry Rig
dataset/train/33_125.wav|Knives. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me
dataset/train/33_126.wav|on Twitter and Instagram. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/34_1.wav|Today we're going to review a newcomer to the folding phone realm, this is the Oppo Find N. Oppo
dataset/train/34_2.wav|is marketing this phone as a novelty to necessity which is a bold claim considering that most
dataset/train/34_3.wav|folding phones are still in the novelty realm. One of the prerequisites though of moving from
dataset/train/34_4.wav|novelty to necessity is durability. So today we're going to put years worth of abuse onto this Oppo
dataset/train/34_5.wav|Find N to see if it can survive. Do you know what else has been around for years though? Our sponsor
dataset/train/34_6.wav|Stamps.com. Stamps.com has been around for 20 years bringing the services of the United States
dataset/train/34_7.wav|Postal Service and UPS right to your computer. Whether you're sending letters like invoices,
dataset/train/34_8.wav|or packages, Stamps.com can handle it all, which is why over a million small businesses like my own
dataset/train/34_9.wav|use Stamps.com. I can print labels, compare rates, and get exclusive discounts from UPS and USPS all
dataset/train/34_10.wav|year long...right from my desk. I mean it's not that I don't like large crowds, standing in lines,
dataset/train/34_11.wav|and traffic, but you know, why go outside when you can just...not. Save time and money with
dataset/train/34_12.wav|Stamps.com. And with my link Stamps.com/JerryRig you get a special discount that includes free
dataset/train/34_13.wav|postage, 4 week trial, and a free digital scale. No long-term commitment or contract,
dataset/train/34_14.wav|and the frosting on top is that you get a 40% discount with USPS and a 76% discount with UPS.
dataset/train/34_15.wav|I'll leave that special link, Stamps.com/JerryRig, right there in the video description. And now
dataset/train/34_16.wav|it's time to find out if the Oppo Find N is novelty, necessity, or nuked. Let's get started.
dataset/train/34_17.wav|The Oppo Find N. Right off the bat I'm going to be honest with you,
dataset/train/34_18.wav|while this folding phone might be a bit different than the rest, it's still way up there in price.
dataset/train/34_19.wav|This guy sits around $1,500. So yeah, it is cheaper than Samsung's Galaxy Fold 3 at $1,800,
dataset/train/34_20.wav|but it still costs substantially more than a normal regular brick phone – even a flagship.
dataset/train/34_21.wav|So the price alone kind of leaves it in the novelty department.
dataset/train/34_22.wav|Form factor-wise though, I do think I like it a bit better than the Fold 3.
dataset/train/34_23.wav|While the Galaxy Fold 3 is skinnier and longer, this guy is shorter but makes up for the length
dataset/train/34_24.wav|with girth and a very usable front screen which you'll see in a second. It also shuts tight.
dataset/train/34_25.wav|No air or light gaps to be seen between the halves. It's very different than the Galaxy
dataset/train/34_26.wav|Fold series which leaves a gap between the inner screens while shut and allows light through.
dataset/train/34_27.wav|And finally, here's the front screen. Girthy, functional, and reachable all with one hand.
dataset/train/34_28.wav|Inside the phone with both halves opened up, it's basically a square which is great for consuming
dataset/train/34_29.wav|square content like Instagram, and YouTube videos from 2007. It does have multitasking though. But
dataset/train/34_30.wav|we aren't here for the software, we're here for the hardware. If this $1,500 phone is indeed a
dataset/train/34_31.wav|necessity then it will be durable. Oppo's bragging about a 12 layer inner display,
dataset/train/34_32.wav|one of which is an ultra thin glass. We'll see if that layer's on top or not. As we can
dataset/train/34_33.wav|see with the exterior screen, the top layer is plastic... a plastic screen protector that is.
dataset/train/34_34.wav|With that gone we continue up our Mohs scale of hardness,
dataset/train/34_35.wav|past the plastic at level 2 to glass which is level 5 or 6.
dataset/train/34_36.wav|The Oppo Find N is using Gorilla Glass Victus
dataset/train/34_37.wav|which scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. Very normal.
dataset/train/34_38.wav|The inner screen, however, a level 2, with deeper grooves at a level 3.
dataset/train/34_39.wav|We knew this was coming, but it's still a little crazy how soft it is.
dataset/train/34_40.wav|Fingernails, coins, and dust are especially a worry since this thing does close tight, trapping
dataset/train/34_41.wav|contaminants inside. The display should always definitely be cleaned or wiped off before closing.
dataset/train/34_42.wav|The ultra thin glass Oppo is talking about is not one of the surface layers and maybe we'll be able
dataset/train/34_43.wav|to find it during the teardown. Until then, let's continue. The exterior front screen glass is also
dataset/train/34_44.wav|protecting a 32 megapixel hole punch selfie camera and the sides of the phone are made from...metal.
dataset/train/34_45.wav|Kind of cool how we can check two sides at the same time when it's shut like this.
dataset/train/34_46.wav|The volume rocker is metal and the fingerprint scanner is scratchable but recessed. The metal at
dataset/train/34_47.wav|the top of the phone has a microphone hole, but the spine, which is signed, designed for Find,
dataset/train/34_48.wav|bear in mind, the grind shall be behind, leave silver straight lined.
dataset/train/34_49.wav|Oppo says there are 136 different components that make up the complexity inside of this hinge
dataset/train/34_50.wav|so it's good to see the exterior is metal, a durable material.
dataset/train/34_51.wav|Let's cross our fingers that we don't see all 136 parts from the inside during this video.
dataset/train/34_52.wav|The bottom, of course, has our 33 watt fast charge USB-C port as well as a dual SIM card tray,
dataset/train/34_53.wav|which does have a water resistant rubber ring around the opening. Good to see Oppo
dataset/train/34_54.wav|has put some thought into water resistance even if it's not officially rated like the
dataset/train/34_55.wav|Galaxy Flip and Fold are. The back of the Oppo Find N is a heavily textured piece of glass.
dataset/train/34_56.wav|The lines you see left behind on the glass are actually little pieces of my razor blade.
dataset/train/34_57.wav|The level 6 glass is actually sanding down my level 5 stainless steel. Instead
dataset/train/34_58.wav|of my knife durability testing the phone, the phone is durability testing my knife.
dataset/train/34_59.wav|I do like the textured glass though, I do wish more phones had it.
dataset/train/34_60.wav|As far as cameras go, we have a 13 megapixel telephoto camera up top, 50 megapixel main
dataset/train/34_61.wav|sensor in the center, and 16 megapixel ultra wide camera down at the bottom all protected
dataset/train/34_62.wav|with little glass circles of their own, along with the dual tone LED flash. Back to the hinge since
dataset/train/34_63.wav|it's one of the things that makes this phone unique. It can hold its position in different
dataset/train/34_64.wav|places while it's being opened. And one big perk over Samsung's Folding phone is that the Oppo Find
dataset/train/34_65.wav|N's crease in the center is 80% less visible due to the larger curve radius it has while closed.
dataset/train/34_66.wav|I know that that crease is a deal breaker for some people and Oppo has done a good job of hiding it.
dataset/train/34_67.wav|They also hide burns pretty well. Even after 30 seconds the screen is still pretty well intact.
dataset/train/34_68.wav|I can tell there is some minor melting on the square 7.1 inch 120 Hertz plastic inner display,
dataset/train/34_69.wav|but not too shabby all things considered. The outer screen is a 5.5 inch AMOLED and
dataset/train/34_70.wav|actually only makes it 20 seconds before getting permanently damaged which proves to us once again
dataset/train/34_71.wav|that nobody should be burning their screen with a lighter. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
dataset/train/34_72.wav|Finally though, it's time to bend the Oppo in ways that make you say uh-oh. Hold on, I almost forgot.
dataset/train/34_73.wav|Out of necessity I will once again venture outside so you don't have to for the dust test.
dataset/train/34_74.wav|With no official water resistance and 136 moving parts inside of the hinge, let's see how much of
dataset/train/34_75.wav|this dust can actually get inside. It makes me extremely nervous that there is no extra space
dataset/train/34_76.wav|between the two halves though. Kind of hard to shut with all these rocks and pebbles inside.
dataset/train/34_77.wav|With all the obstructions there is definitely a gap now. I'll wiggle the dust around on the
dataset/train/34_78.wav|screen and hinge for good measure and get some good coating on the backside and top edges.
dataset/train/34_79.wav|There's more dust here on my desk and phone than the phone should ever reasonably encounter in
dataset/train/34_80.wav|everyday life if you're one of those people who take care of it. But yet if we listen closely,
dataset/train/34_81.wav|the hinge still sounds pretty pristine. Nice work, Oppo. I'll slam it shut a few times,
dataset/train/34_82.wav|clean it off, and assess the damage to the surface. While there are significantly more
dataset/train/34_83.wav|marks and divots on the inner screen, it is less than I anticipated. It's not too bad...until
dataset/train/34_84.wav|you remember this costs $1,500 and then the damage hurts a little more.
dataset/train/34_85.wav|Finally, we know the phone is supposed to bend inward, and with the thickness of the
dataset/train/34_86.wav|phone folded shut it's nobody's surprise that it's solid while closed from both sides. But
dataset/train/34_87.wav|will the Oppo Find N bend backwards and break? There's only one way to find out.
dataset/train/34_88.wav|No, no it will not. Sitting on this phone while open might slightly scratch or damage the soft
dataset/train/34_89.wav|inner screen, but structurally this Oppo Find N is solid. I'm still a bit shocked every time my
dataset/train/34_90.wav|folding phone doesn't snap in half though. It just seems like they should. Does this Find N
dataset/train/34_91.wav|move phones from novelty to necessity though? I mean it is cool, but until folding displays
dataset/train/34_92.wav|are on pare with regular phones cost-wise, I think they remain solidly in the novelty realm.
dataset/train/34_93.wav|That's just my opinion though, what do you think? Let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/34_94.wav|And which folding phone form factor is your favorite so far? I'm curios. Come
dataset/train/34_95.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/35_1.wav|It's time for the 2021 Smartphone Durability Awards. It feels good to finally close out 2021.
dataset/train/35_2.wav|Not quite as crazy as 2020, but still, you know, good to put it behind us. It's been a pretty big
dataset/train/35_3.wav|year. We installed some off-grid solar panels on my barn. Plugged some fruit trees into the
dataset/train/35_4.wav|ground. Introduced two new JerryRig knife flavors. And introduced JerryRig Jr. into the world...all
dataset/train/35_5.wav|while pulling the guts out of a military Humvee, installed an electric motor,
dataset/train/35_6.wav|building batteries, and getting it rolling under its own electric power. It's been a busy year,
dataset/train/35_7.wav|but we've also had a lot of time to durability test and tear down plenty of smartphones.
dataset/train/35_8.wav|Unfortunately though, it has not been a good year for smartphone durability. We've had more
dataset/train/35_9.wav|phones break this year than any other year. The ROG Phone 5 catastrophically kicked the bucket,
dataset/train/35_10.wav|along with the Legion Dual 2...just snapped in half.
dataset/train/35_11.wav|And a brand-new phone called the Carbon 1 MK II lived out it's few minutes of life right here on my desk.
dataset/train/35_12.wav|We've had a lot of smartphones break this year, but what makes it a little awkward is that none of
dataset/train/35_13.wav|the folding phones, which you would expect to be fragile, ended up breaking. Along with the iPad,
dataset/train/35_14.wav|which we would also expect to be fragile, survived the durability test. So today we'll be giving
dataset/train/35_15.wav|out the Smartphone Durability Awards of 2021. Should be pretty interesting. Let's get started.
dataset/train/35_16.wav|Let's start things off with the most repairable smartphone of 2021, and that goes to, no one's
dataset/train/35_17.wav|surprise, the Fairphone 4, which is actually designed to be taken apart, has a removable
dataset/train/35_18.wav|battery, and replacement parts available directly from the manufacturer. Fairphone is miles ahead
dataset/train/35_19.wav|of everyone else when it comes to repairability. Interestingly enough though, Apple announced a new
dataset/train/35_20.wav|program starting in 2022 called self service repair where people can start to fix their
dataset/train/35_21.wav|own iPhones. So it'll be interesting to see how that goes. But as for 2021, the Fairphone 4 takes
dataset/train/35_22.wav|first place. Runner up though would probably be the Pixel 6 Pro with just some adhesive,
dataset/train/35_23.wav|one screw and one little ribbon holding the screen to the body. A screen repair could
dataset/train/35_24.wav|probably be done in about 60 seconds. So runner up for most repairable phone goes to the Pixel 6 Pro.
dataset/train/35_25.wav|Now as far as the least repairable smartphone of 2021, that has to go to the iPhone 13 Pro
dataset/train/35_26.wav|Max. While the screen repair itself is relatively easy, the problem comes with the different screws
dataset/train/35_27.wav|of different sizes, as well as the digitally locked parts. But the biggest issue in what wins
dataset/train/35_28.wav|this phone the lease repairable smartphone of 2021 is the rear glass replacement. The
dataset/train/35_29.wav|glass is permanently installed onto the phone and impossible to replace. And Apple charges $599 for
dataset/train/35_30.wav|them to fix it. And it's one of the most common things that would ever break on an iPhone. Of
dataset/train/35_31.wav|course if the rear glass ever does break, instead of paying $599 for the replacement, you can just
dataset/train/35_32.wav|grab a Teardown Skin. Far easier, and after all, pretending not to be broken is what life is all
dataset/train/35_33.wav|about. It'll be interesting to see if Apple's repair program does include these pieces of glass
dataset/train/35_34.wav|and hopefully someday Apple will build their phones in a way that can be repaired. Until then
dataset/train/35_35.wav|though, this glass ridiculousness is what earns them the least repairable smartphone of 2021.
dataset/train/35_36.wav|The most innovative smartphone of 2021 was a hard one. We didn't have the craziness of last
dataset/train/35_37.wav|year with the LG Wing, as it would flip out in a T-shape with its dual screens. Everyone here
dataset/train/35_38.wav|kind of played it safe. Samsung, however, managed to do something relatively unique...waterproofing
dataset/train/35_39.wav|their folding phones – both the Flip 3 and the Fold 3, all while building it strong enough that
dataset/train/35_40.wav|they survived the durability test and I could completely disassemble the Flip and put it back
dataset/train/35_41.wav|together in one working piece. So even though it's been around for a few generations now,
dataset/train/35_42.wav|those improvements make the Samsung Galaxy Flip 3 the most innovative smartphone of 2021.
dataset/train/35_43.wav|But what about the best looking smartphone on the inside? The Galaxy Flip 3 does look pretty
dataset/train/35_44.wav|sweet with it's gold contact pad and multicolored motherboards. Along with the iPhone 13's magnets
dataset/train/35_45.wav|on the back surrounding its copper coil. It was pretty hard to decide this year because we
dataset/train/35_46.wav|also have the Microsoft Duo 2 which looks pretty stealthy inside with it's black motherboards and
dataset/train/35_47.wav|long batteries. Stuff we don't normally see inside of smartphones. But if I had to pick just one,
dataset/train/35_48.wav|it would probably be the Legion Duel 2 which probably had the most packed inside of it of
dataset/train/35_49.wav|any other phone this year. With its dual internal cooling fans, copper ductwork,
dataset/train/35_50.wav|RGB lights, ultrasonic triggers, and a stepper motor with a popup camera. It was just a super
dataset/train/35_51.wav|cool all-around phone. I mean, yeah, it did kind of open up unintentionally during the bend test,
dataset/train/35_52.wav|and didn't exactly live very long. But other than that, I think the Legion Duel 2 is the
dataset/train/35_53.wav|best looking smartphone from the inside, even if it was dead, and that sounds kind of creepy.
dataset/train/35_54.wav|Which brings us to the least durable smartphone of 2021. Now we did have a lot to pick from,
dataset/train/35_55.wav|but if I had to pick one it would again go to the Legion Duel 2. This thing started off
dataset/train/35_56.wav|heavy and solid and I just thought, you know, it gave me no indication that it was going to
dataset/train/35_57.wav|snap in half...until it snapped in half. And it might very well be the easiest phone to
dataset/train/35_58.wav|snap in half of all time, giving the Nextbit Robin from back in 2016 a run for its money.
dataset/train/35_59.wav|And that phone was plastic. So while this might be the coolest looking phone from the inside,
dataset/train/35_60.wav|it doesn't help a whole lot when you can't survive on the outside. The Legion Duel 2
dataset/train/35_61.wav|wins the least durable smartphone of 2021. I also have another award called the delusive
dataset/train/35_62.wav|award which is given to a smartphone manufacturer who kind of had some misleading advertising. But
dataset/train/35_63.wav|I think so far this year, 2021, most smartphones arrived as they were advertised, so we'll put that
dataset/train/35_64.wav|award on the back burner and save it for maybe next year. It's not an award you want to win.
dataset/train/35_65.wav|As far as the most durable smartphone of 2021, it comes to no one's surprise yet again
dataset/train/35_66.wav|that it goes to the Kyocera Duraforce Ultra 5G. This guy is a tank with a rubberized
dataset/train/35_67.wav|plastic body that can survive 5 foot drops onto concrete. It also has a pure sapphire
dataset/train/35_68.wav|display which is scratch resistant to a level 8 on Mohs scale of hardness.
dataset/train/35_69.wav|Exponentially harder than a tempered glass Mohs 6. It's also not just water resistant,
dataset/train/35_70.wav|it's waterproof and liquid damage is covered under warranty. Since it has a sticky rubber gasket
dataset/train/35_71.wav|inlaid between the two halves of the phone to keep water out. It's protections like that that
dataset/train/35_72.wav|we usually see in underwater drones. So while it might not be the sleekest looking phone of 2021,
dataset/train/35_73.wav|it is by far hands down the most durable. Remember that any one of these smartphones on my desk,
dataset/train/35_74.wav|including the one in your pocket could be considered the most durable as long as it
dataset/train/35_75.wav|has a case and a screen protector. Personally I always have a case on
dataset/train/35_76.wav|my own phone which is the Galaxy Note 10 from back in 2019...you know, in the before-times.
dataset/train/35_77.wav|Smartphones these days are really good and end up lasting for a really long time so it's a good idea
dataset/train/35_78.wav|to protect your investment. You don't have to buy a new phone if your current phone isn't broken.
dataset/train/35_79.wav|And that concludes the smartphone durability awards of 2021. I'm curious though, you know,
dataset/train/35_80.wav|obviously these are my opinions. I'm curious to hear yours. Do you think a different phone should
dataset/train/35_81.wav|have won a particular award? Let me know down in the comments. Up to this point in the video I've
dataset/train/35_82.wav|been talking about physical protection for your smartphones, but what about digitally protecting
dataset/train/35_83.wav|yourself online? Huge thanks to NordVPN for sponsoring this video. A VPN or virtual private

dataset/train/35_97.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/36_1.wav|In front of us today we have the Mi 11 Ultra, which is arguably one of the most powerful
dataset/train/36_2.wav|phones of 2021. And does have the largest camera sensor and probably camera bump of any phone ever.
dataset/train/36_3.wav|The problem with that camera bump though is that it might provide the theoretical dotted line for
dataset/train/36_4.wav|the phone to snap along during the durability test. Xiaomi phones don't have the best track
dataset/train/36_5.wav|record for surviving. You know what does have a great track record though? Stamps.com. I've been
dataset/train/36_6.wav|using stamps.com for the last year to ship out all of my shirts and my JerryRigEverything knives. Got
dataset/train/36_7.wav|some new colors by the way. We have the regular blue, we also have red, and metal. This new batch
dataset/train/36_8.wav|of knives does have upgraded paint and should arrive just in time for Christmas. Thanks again
dataset/train/36_9.wav|to stamps.com. Stamps.com makes it easy for me to do everything from my computer without leaving my
dataset/train/36_10.wav|house. From buying postage, to printing labels, to even scheduling pickups. Plus I get exclusive
dataset/train/36_11.wav|discounts, like up to 40% from UPSP, and up to 76% from UPS. So if you have your own office,
dataset/train/36_12.wav|business, or side hustle, stamps.com can save you a lot of time and money this holiday season.
dataset/train/36_13.wav|To get your 4-week trial, free postage, and free digital scale, just head to stamps.com/jerryrig.
dataset/train/36_14.wav|There are no long-term commitments or contracts so if you spend more than a few minutes a week
dataset/train/36_15.wav|dealing with shipping and postage, stamps.com is a real time saver. Stamps.com/jerryrig.
dataset/train/36_16.wav|Now let's see how durable the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra really is. Let's get started.
dataset/train/36_17.wav|In the past, Xiaomi might have been known as more of a budget brand of smartphones,
dataset/train/36_18.wav|but that's not the case with this Mi 11 Ultra. It's an ultra phone with an ultra $1000 price tag.
dataset/train/36_19.wav|Inside the box we'll get our usual clear plastic silicon case. I think mine might be defective
dataset/train/36_20.wav|since it's missing the whole top half. The phone's got his tender resume on the protective plastic,
dataset/train/36_21.wav|with a 50 megapixel main camera, 120 hertz display, and 67 watts of fast charging.
dataset/train/36_22.wav|But out of the box, holy cow is this the mothership of all camera bumps.
dataset/train/36_23.wav|The rest of the box has the 67 watt fast charging brick and USB-C cable, but I'll come back to that
dataset/train/36_24.wav|because this camera bump is nuts.
dataset/train/36_25.wav|When compared to the Pixel 6 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which we all thought were already
dataset/train/36_26.wav|large camera bumps, this Mi 11 Ultra is a giant. It's a camera attached to a phone
dataset/train/36_27.wav|instead of a phone attached to a camera. For reference, the Pixel 6 Pro is one
dataset/train/36_28.wav|whole spaghetti noodle thick, while the Mi 11 Ultra has two whopping noodles of clearance.
dataset/train/36_29.wav|If you aren't fluent in noodle, it's 3 ½ millimeters. Pretty crazy. Other
dataset/train/36_30.wav|than that though this phone does look pretty normal. Curved screen glass on all four edges,
dataset/train/36_31.wav|and a shade of black so dark on the back that my camera struggles to even pick it up.
dataset/train/36_32.wav|There is a cool rear display though inside that camera bump. Apparently Xiaomi took one of their
dataset/train/36_33.wav|little watch displays and plopped it next to the camera lenses. It'll be a pretty fun teardown.
dataset/train/36_34.wav|But first, the scratch test. As we know, plastic phones start scratching at a level 2 or 3,
dataset/train/36_35.wav|like the soft flexible screens on Samsung's folding phones...And
dataset/train/36_36.wav|this Mi 11 Ultra's screen protector that I forgot to take off.
dataset/train/36_37.wav|Continuing on. I'll be honest, it's nice that this phone isn't rocking since the camera extends
dataset/train/36_38.wav|across the whole back. It's basically thick enough to almost act as a kickstand. Glass
dataset/train/36_39.wav|scratches at a 5 or 6. Sapphire would be an 8 or 9. This Mi 11 Ultra is using Gorilla Glass Victus
dataset/train/36_40.wav|so we start seeing scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. So far, so good.
dataset/train/36_41.wav|The hole punch 20 megapixel front-facing 1080p camera
dataset/train/36_42.wav|is also protected under that Victus glass with the super thin earpiece slit up at the top.
dataset/train/36_43.wav|The sides are made from aluminum, along with the singular power button
dataset/train/36_44.wav|and volume rocker – both metal. The top of the phone is where things get interesting.
dataset/train/36_45.wav|It doesn't sound the same, and the razor blade of truth discovers that this Mi 11 Ultra has a
dataset/train/36_46.wav|plastic top very similar to the plastic top on the Pixel 6 Pro, except for this plastic peels
dataset/train/36_47.wav|away. It covers the top loudspeaker as well as the infrared channel changing remote LED, which is a
dataset/train/36_48.wav|pretty cool feature. And yeah, realistically this probably won't be ever falling off on it's own
dataset/train/36_49.wav|since the adhesive is extremely strong. But it is good to know what the phone is made of.
dataset/train/36_50.wav|The left side is back to metal again and the bottom of the phone has our
dataset/train/36_51.wav|second stereo loudspeaker. With that 67 watt fast charging USB-C port
dataset/train/36_52.wav|and the IP68 water-resistant dual SIM card tray with it's rubber ring around the opening.
dataset/train/36_53.wav|Another interesting thing besides the tiny display on the back is that the back panel of
dataset/train/36_54.wav|this Mi 11 Ultra is supposedly made from ceramic. We've seen ceramic on a few phones in the past,
dataset/train/36_55.wav|like the Essential Phone a few years ago, may it rest in peace. Ceramics are inorganic materials
dataset/train/36_56.wav|that are heated up or fired at high temperatures to harden them, usually landing somewhere between
dataset/train/36_57.wav|a level 7 or 8 on Mohs scale of hardness. Ceramic floor or wall tiles are very scratch resistant,
dataset/train/36_58.wav|and the same goes for this back panel. Looking closely I do see faint markings at
dataset/train/36_59.wav|a level 6 and 7. But that might just be the ceramic acting like sandpaper to my picks.
dataset/train/36_60.wav|The only actual damage happens at a level 8 with deeper grooves at a level 9. So this back panel
dataset/train/36_61.wav|is indeed ceramic and stronger than tempered glass. Thumbs up for that. Nice work, Xiaomi.
dataset/train/36_62.wav|Finally, the camera lens. This behemoth is the largest camera sensor ever in a smartphone. We'll
dataset/train/36_63.wav|have to measure it from the inside when we take it apart. We have the 50 megapixel main sensor,
dataset/train/36_64.wav|a 48 megapixel ultra wide at 128 degrees,
dataset/train/36_65.wav|and a 48 megapixel 120x digital zoom periscoping telephoto camera. Xiaomi went all out with
dataset/train/36_66.wav|this thing and at two noodles thick there is definitely plenty of room for all that hardware.
dataset/train/36_67.wav|The front screen on the Mi 11 Ultra is a 10 bit 1 billion color HDR 10 Plus, 120 Hertz 1700 nits,
dataset/train/36_68.wav|6.8 inch 1440p AMOLED -as we can tell from the pixels going white after about 20 seconds.
dataset/train/36_69.wav|I almost needed to burn a little longer there just to get through all the phone specs. But
dataset/train/36_70.wav|surprisingly the pixels did recover. Last thing before the bend test is testing the fingerprint
dataset/train/36_71.wav|scanner. Xiaomi plopped this optical boy under the screen which is fine. A lot of people like it
dataset/train/36_72.wav|there. I find myself just giving up on my Note 10 Plus's scanner more often than not though and just
dataset/train/36_73.wav|typing in my code, so to each their own. But it does look like this scanner can still scan through
dataset/train/36_74.wav|an unrealistic amount of level 7 deeper grooves on the glass. So that is good news. And now it's time
dataset/train/36_75.wav|to see if this Mi 11 Ultra will snap in half the same way we snapped in half the Mi 5. To be fair,
dataset/train/36_76.wav|it has been a few years since we've had a Xiaomi phone break, but someone does have to keep them on
dataset/train/36_77.wav|their toes. When bent from the front we get the smallest of flexes. And when bent from the back
dataset/train/36_78.wav|we get the exact same results. The quad curved Gorilla Glass Victus and the dual curve ceramic
dataset/train/36_79.wav|combined with the metal frame make this Mi 11 Ultra a super solid camera bump of a smartphone.
dataset/train/36_80.wav|The Mi 11 Ultra survives my durability test. It's a big phone with a big price and big results. You
dataset/train/36_81.wav|know what doesn't have a big price though? My red, metal, and blue JerryRigEverything knives. Plus,
dataset/train/36_82.wav|if you order today they should still arrive by Christmas if you're in the USA. I'll leave a link
dataset/train/36_83.wav|down next to the free trial from stamps.com. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/36_84.wav|hang out with me on Twitter and Instagram. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/37_1.wav|Today we're going to be durability testing a brand new, modular, flagship smartphone – The FairPhone
dataset/train/37_2.wav|4 5G. But first I have a little story time and a desktop tour as you can see behind me. This video
dataset/train/37_3.wav|is sponsored by GT Racing. Behind me is where I edit a lot of my videos, and I spend a ridiculous
dataset/train/37_4.wav|amount of time in this corner. This right here is the computer I built. And this computer, along
dataset/train/37_5.wav|with these two monitors I've been using for about 3 years or so. And they've been working great,
dataset/train/37_6.wav|even after all this time. Right here is where I do my voiceovers - this little microphone.
dataset/train/37_7.wav|It's a simple Samson Meteor mic. And I can just swing this arm around,
dataset/train/37_8.wav|put it in front of my computer and do all the voiceovers for my videos. I've found
dataset/train/37_9.wav|that inexpensive things get the job done just fine, without needing to spend a bazillion bucks.
dataset/train/37_10.wav|And GT Racing has that same philosophy. They've sent me the rest of this setup so I can show
dataset/train/37_11.wav|it off to you guys. The desk has a carbon fiber aesthetic, along with plenty of RGB gaming lights,
dataset/train/37_12.wav|because we all know RGBs improve FPS's. It's also got a headphone holder and a spin out drink holder
dataset/train/37_13.wav|because it's modular and efficient like that. It's large enough to hold my ultra
dataset/train/37_14.wav|wide gaming monitor and strong enough to hold a hundred and eighty pounds.
dataset/train/37_15.wav|You might be wondering why I have a shattered GoPro on my desk.
dataset/train/37_16.wav|Well I actually took this to the Tesla CyberTruck launch about two years ago and I tried to get
dataset/train/37_17.wav|a really cool shot by placing this in the road and hoping that the CyberTruck would drive over
dataset/train/37_18.wav|it. Well it turns out the CyberTruck actually did drive over it and smooshed my GoPro with
dataset/train/37_19.wav|it's 35 inch tires. The camera was recording and I'll try to play some of that for you right now,
dataset/train/37_20.wav|but it did stop recording as the truck was about 5 feet away...Or the footage was corrupted at least.
dataset/train/37_21.wav|Oh is that it? It's totally dead! But yeah, you win some and you lose some.
dataset/train/37_22.wav|And speaking of winning, the chair that I'm sitting in is also from GT Racing. Nothing
dataset/train/37_23.wav|improves crosshair accuracy like a stylized gaming chair. It's pretty firm and has the ability to lay
dataset/train/37_24.wav|completely flat with the attached leg rest. So you can take a little nappy nap between gaming
dataset/train/37_25.wav|sessions. It can hold up to 300 pounds, and crazy enough, has dual Bluetooth surround sound
dataset/train/37_26.wav|speakers in the backrest. I'll have links for all this stuff down in the video description
dataset/train/37_27.wav|including the RGB keyboard and mouse, but if you or a young gamer in your life want a lot of
dataset/train/37_28.wav|RGB's really quick at a good price, GT Racing has you covered. Of course you can get just a
dataset/train/37_29.wav|few lights if intergalactic space rave isn't your thing. But if you're going for that psychedelic
dataset/train/37_30.wav|utopia vibe, I'll leave all the links down below. They do make great gifts – just saying.
dataset/train/37_31.wav|Now it's time to see if this modular flagship can survive a durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/37_32.wav|The FairPhone 4 5G. While smartphone manufacturers might not specifically plan for
dataset/train/37_33.wav|planned obsolescence, they sure don't do anything to mitigate it. FairPhone is different. This baby
dataset/train/37_34.wav|is designed from the ground up to last as long as possible and has a 5 year warranty to prove
dataset/train/37_35.wav|it. Inside the box we get the phone. No additional cords or charging bricks – just the phone itself.
dataset/train/37_36.wav|With it's triangular camera lens on the back. It does come in all your favorite colors though,
dataset/train/37_37.wav|as long as your favorite colors are gray or green. It's also surprisingly heavy out of the box,
dataset/train/37_38.wav|which is totally fine by me. It makes it feel solid, but is it solid? There's only one way
dataset/train/37_39.wav|to find out. The screwdriver you see on the table next to me actually comes shipped with the phone
dataset/train/37_40.wav|cuz FairPhone knows that you don't really own something unless you can fix and repair it.
dataset/train/37_41.wav|The back panel is removable, along with everything else in here.
dataset/train/37_42.wav|It's all modular including the battery – all 3,905 milliamp hours of it. This has definitely been the
dataset/train/37_43.wav|easiest battery replacement of 2021. Thumbs up for that. The rest of the components are held in place
dataset/train/37_44.wav|by 12 silver screws. Since this phone is designed to be taken apart, we won't be compromising the
dataset/train/37_45.wav|structural integrity if we just take a little tour first. With the screws gone we can take a look at
dataset/train/37_46.wav|the bottom module. It's got the loudspeaker and coin style vibrator attached to it,
dataset/train/37_47.wav|along with some waterproofing mesh at the speaker opening.
dataset/train/37_48.wav|This phone is IP54, so there are some protections against spraying water but not submersion. Not
dataset/train/37_49.wav|too shabby though considering there is no glue holding the back panel or the screen.
dataset/train/37_50.wav|I'll unplug the three camera ribbon cables up at the top just like little Legos,
dataset/train/37_51.wav|and then the upper module is free. These modules aren't the barebone components though. They're
dataset/train/37_52.wav|more like building blocks designed to be easily replaceable by people who have no experience.
dataset/train/37_53.wav|The USB-C charging pot which can charge at 20 watts is also modular.
dataset/train/37_54.wav|We have the earpiece and front facing 20-megapixel camera which has internal electronic image
dataset/train/37_55.wav|stabilization. We can tell that the inside of the phone is made from a solid block of metal.
dataset/train/37_56.wav|Scratching is scientifically enlightening, but we can also visibly tell by the mill markings from
dataset/train/37_57.wav|the milling machine in the battery tray. This is a pretty solid upgrade from last year's FairPhone.
dataset/train/37_58.wav|You might be asking yourself, 'Hey Jerry, what about the screen though?' We do know that screens
dataset/train/37_59.wav|are usually one of the most expensive and hard to replace components in a smartphone. But if
dataset/train/37_60.wav|we remove the 8 black Phillips head screws with that same screwdriver, I can run my fingernail
dataset/train/37_61.wav|around the exterior edge of the phone and pretty easily separate the screen module from the body.
dataset/train/37_62.wav|It has one little ribbon connector on this side that plugs into the motherboard. I bet an
dataset/train/37_63.wav|expert screwer could replace the display on this FairPhone 4 in about 5 minutes. Interesting that
dataset/train/37_64.wav|there's even a copper heat pipe inside to help dissipate the heat from the internal processor.
dataset/train/37_65.wav|Well, we have proved that it's modular. Now it's time to see if it survived so we can try
dataset/train/37_66.wav|killing it again. With the screen situated and the earpiece, front camera, and charging port
dataset/train/37_67.wav|all plugged in, we can plop the camera module and loudspeaker module back into place with
dataset/train/37_68.wav|those 20 screws holding everything together. The battery can slide in and the back panel can clip
dataset/train/37_69.wav|down into place. This reminds me of how all smartphone repairs were about 10 years ago.
dataset/train/37_70.wav|And everything still works. Let's see if we can make it not work, starting with the scratch test.
dataset/train/37_71.wav|You know the drill. Plastic is a 2 or 3. Glass is a 5 or 6.
dataset/train/37_72.wav|And sapphire is a level 8 or 9. FairPhone says they have Gorilla Glass 5 on this flagship and we
dataset/train/37_73.wav|can confirm that with scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. The teardrop notch
dataset/train/37_74.wav|up at top contains the 25 megapixel front facing camera that we saw from the inside earlier. There
dataset/train/37_75.wav|is no plastic speaker grill, just a long slip up at the top for the earpiece - aesthetically
dataset/train/37_76.wav|following the example of other modern flagships. The sides of the phone are made from...metal.
dataset/train/37_77.wav|You can see the glint of silver showing up through the gray anodizing. The recessed power
dataset/train/37_78.wav|button does double as a fingerprint scanner and we have two metal volume buttons up top.
dataset/train/37_79.wav|The upper edge of the phone is made from metal, along with the entire left side.
dataset/train/37_80.wav|The little notch at the bottom edge is to facilitate the removal of that back panel.
dataset/train/37_81.wav|The bottom has the USB-C, loudspeaker, and microphone. The rear camera lens might look like
dataset/train/37_82.wav|it has three perspectives but it's actually just a 48 megapixel ultra wide, a 48 megapixel main
dataset/train/37_83.wav|camera with OIS, and the last little circle is for the 3D time-of-flight depth camera and dual flash,
dataset/train/37_84.wav|but still an improvement over last year's singular camera.
dataset/train/37_85.wav|FairPhone has pretty bravely decided to take on all of the injustices of the smartphone industry
dataset/train/37_86.wav|at once. Whether it's mining, recycling, repairability, or fair wages.
dataset/train/37_87.wav|It's a big task. They are also electronic waste neutral,
dataset/train/37_88.wav|which means for every phone they sell they recycle an equal amount of electronic waste.
dataset/train/37_89.wav|And last year they sold about 100,000 phones, so no small amount.
dataset/train/37_90.wav|You can check out their website for the nitty-gritty, but combining sustainability,
dataset/train/37_91.wav|recycling, and repairability, it makes the planet pretty happy. For a flagship,
dataset/train/37_92.wav|the FairPhone 4 does have a 6.3 inch 1080p 60hz display which lasts about 10 seconds under my
dataset/train/37_93.wav|lighter before the pixels go black and turn off. We don't see IPS displays as often anymore. The
dataset/train/37_94.wav|iPhones and Samsungs of the world have moved to OLED for that higher refresh rate and brighter
dataset/train/37_95.wav|colors. But if we're being honest, the average non-nerd wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
dataset/train/37_96.wav|Finally, the bend test. What's the point of a woke environmentally friendly 5 year warranty
dataset/train/37_97.wav|if it can't survive a little abuse? And, well, when bent from the back, there's hardly any flex.
dataset/train/37_98.wav|And we get the same structurally solid results when bent from the front.
dataset/train/37_99.wav|Pretty impressive. The metal modular FairPhone 4 survives my durability test. The biggest
dataset/train/37_100.wav|issue I see with this phone though is that it's currently only sold in Europe. I think there are
dataset/train/37_101.wav|a lot of people here in the USA and other places who might not care about the latest
dataset/train/37_102.wav|and greatest flashy thin trend and just want a phone that works good for a really long time.
dataset/train/37_103.wav|And that 5 year warranty is a really long time – and all for less than $600.
dataset/train/37_104.wav|I'm a huge fan of where FairPhone is headed. Nice work. Do you prefer new
dataset/train/37_105.wav|and flashy or solid and sustainable? Let me know your thoughts down in the comments. Come
dataset/train/37_106.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/38_1.wav|Today we're going to be doing a durability on Microsoft's newest phone – The Surface Duo 2 that
dataset/train/38_2.wav|costs $1,500. It's got two screens though which means our durability test will be twice as fun.
dataset/train/38_3.wav|This video is sponsored by Stamps.com. Personally, I use Stamps.com on a very regular basis. I ship
dataset/train/38_4.wav|out my JerryRigEverything knives, and I will be shipping out this limited edition

dataset/train/38_6.wav|ask? Well it's because I never have to leave my house. Time is money and with Stamps.com I have
dataset/train/38_7.wav|all the access I need to UPS and to USPS. I can compare rates and print labels right from
dataset/train/38_8.wav|my own computer. If you spend more than a few minutes a week dealing with mail and shipping,
dataset/train/38_9.wav|Stamps.com is a real time saver. Join the 1 million other businesses using Stamps.com

dataset/train/38_11.wav|for a special 4-week trial, free postage, and a free 5 pound digital scale.
dataset/train/38_12.wav|No long term commitment or contracts. It's super easy. Stamps.com/JerryRig and I will literally be
dataset/train/38_13.wav|using it right after we finish this durability test. Speaking of which, let's get started.
dataset/train/38_14.wav|In front of us today we have the Microsoft Surface Duo 2.
dataset/train/38_15.wav|Last year's Duo 1 was concerningly flexible in some weird places,
dataset/train/38_16.wav|but did ultimately survive my durability test so this should be interesting. Inside the box
dataset/train/38_17.wav|we see there is no charging brick, just a USB-C charging cable. Lack of a brick is fine with me,
dataset/train/38_18.wav|I have about 700 sitting in a drawer. I'm not sure what the rest of y'all are doing though.
dataset/train/38_19.wav|Apparently the Duo 2 is all about multitasking...kind
dataset/train/38_20.wav|of like having 2 displays on your desktop. The biggest difference between this year's Duo
dataset/train/38_21.wav|and last year's Duo is that Microsoft has actually added cameras this time around and that
dataset/train/38_22.wav|camera bump is slightly angled so the phone can still flip all the way around and kind of close
dataset/train/38_23.wav|together...kind of. Seems a little out of place, not going to lie, but not a deal breaker. Having
dataset/train/38_24.wav|cameras is more important than it folding flat. But it's kind of a bummer we have to compromise.
dataset/train/38_25.wav|The hinge holds it's place at any point during the opening process and can be propped up like
dataset/train/38_26.wav|a laptop so you can set it on a table and watch YouTube videos on the upright screen.
dataset/train/38_27.wav|It's also got magnets on the back which can be used to mount Microsoft's stylus to the phone. And
dataset/train/38_28.wav|once again, I am a fan of this design, with some caveats though, but I'll get to those in a second.
dataset/train/38_29.wav|First, let's scratch the screens. Normally with folding phones like the Samsung Z Flip
dataset/train/38_30.wav|and the Z Fold, the folding screen is made from a super soft plastic. We can see what
dataset/train/38_31.wav|material the screen is made from on this Duo 2 by using the Mohs scale of hardness. A level 2
dataset/train/38_32.wav|or 3 would be plastic. A level 5 or 6 would be glass, and a level 8 or 9 would be sapphire.
dataset/train/38_33.wav|Luckily we start seeing scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7.
dataset/train/38_34.wav|And scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7,
dataset/train/38_35.wav|which does make this the most scratch resistant folding phone we've tested so far this year.
dataset/train/38_36.wav|No plastic screens here. Now this does mean there is a substantial gap and bezel between the two
dataset/train/38_37.wav|halves, just like you would expect on dual desktop displays. The front facing camera is protected by
dataset/train/38_38.wav|that same Gorilla Glass Victus. The sides of this $700 smartphone in 6 months are made from plastic,
dataset/train/38_39.wav|like we see around the USB-C port and the plastic SIM card tray.
dataset/train/38_40.wav|Microsoft actually tweeted that their phone is IPX1, which means it's water resistant to singular
dataset/train/38_41.wav|droplets of vertically falling water, like the tears of Duo owners after seeing the price drop.
dataset/train/38_42.wav|You should still grab a tissue though because the IP rating system only counts in fresh water
dataset/train/38_43.wav|and not salt water. And this entire frame and buttons are made from plastic...minus
dataset/train/38_44.wav|the hinge. The hinge is made from metal.
dataset/train/38_45.wav|One cool little gimmick though, if we plug in my Anker power bank we can see that the
dataset/train/38_46.wav|charging indicator notifies us through the curved glass on the spine of the phone. This
dataset/train/38_47.wav|also works for notifications, and if you have a magnifying glass you can even see a little clock.
dataset/train/38_48.wav|Samsung, of course, solved the notification issue by adding a whole front display
dataset/train/38_49.wav|which would have been useful here on the Duo 2 instead of just peeking through the hinge. If you
dataset/train/38_50.wav|have to pick up and kink your phone to the side to see notifications, you might as well just open it.
dataset/train/38_51.wav|One substantial improvement over last year's Duo though is that this time around instead of only
dataset/train/38_52.wav|having one internal selfie camera to work with, we finally have some real cameras on the back. A 12
dataset/train/38_53.wav|megapixel normal camera, a 12 megapixel telephoto, and a 16 megapixel ultra wide – all protected
dataset/train/38_54.wav|under that same angled glass camera bump. I'm a fan of this improvement. However, I don't deal
dataset/train/38_55.wav|much with software during my reviews, but having watched other reviews on YouTube, I understand
dataset/train/38_56.wav|that this Duo 2 is still just as finicky as the Duo 1, which is unfortunate. With it's dual 5.8
dataset/train/38_57.wav|inch 90 hertz displays, Microsoft could really come out swinging...if they ditched Android. And
dataset/train/38_58.wav|hear me out. Microsoft should own what they own, drop Android and plop a full fledged
dataset/train/38_59.wav|Windows operating system on here. The Surface Pro tablets running full Windows are pretty amazing.
dataset/train/38_60.wav|Luckily we have two screens to burn so I can keep on talking. Microsoft could crush the
dataset/train/38_61.wav|mobile productivity space in ways that no one else can. But here they are, trying to adapt a super
dataset/train/38_62.wav|creative phone to an Android operating system that prefers boring rectangles. The Surface Duo 2 is
dataset/train/38_63.wav|just begging to be a full fledged PC in my pocket, but it's being held back by Android. Can you
dataset/train/38_64.wav|imagine pulling a full Windows 11 PC out of your pants. It already does 4K video over USB-C so I
dataset/train/38_65.wav|could connect to external monitors while traveling by adding a Bluetooth, mouse, and keyboard...I'm
dataset/train/38_66.wav|getting excited just thinking about it. I'd never bring my laptop anywhere ever again, which is
dataset/train/38_67.wav|actually probably the very reason why Microsoft doesn't do it. The dual AMOLED screens both
dataset/train/38_68.wav|lasted an incredibly long time under my lighter though without leaving much of a mark at all.
dataset/train/38_69.wav|Finally, we do have a side mounted fingerprint reader, which normally
dataset/train/38_70.wav|I do prefer, but since this one is made from plastic, and I already scratched it,
dataset/train/38_71.wav|it's having a hard time performing. I think we can let it slide though, it's kind of had a hard day.
dataset/train/38_72.wav|Now it's time to see how structurally solid this multitasking glass and plastic sandwich really
dataset/train/38_73.wav|is. Yeah, I can fold at 360 degrees minus a few for that camera bump, but one annoying thing is
dataset/train/38_74.wav|that the phone does have to be opened each time you get a phone call and closed again after the
dataset/train/38_75.wav|call is over. Luckily, even when slammed shut with an exorbitant amount of force, the glass is not
dataset/train/38_76.wav|cracked. Slamming it shut backwards also has no effect on the phone. Nice work so far, Microsoft.
dataset/train/38_77.wav|Now the bend test. When bent from whatever side this is, we don't see any flex from the hinge,
dataset/train/38_78.wav|but we do see some massive flex from the other end of the phone.
dataset/train/38_79.wav|I'm going to say the true winner here is the Gorilla Glass Victus bending and flexing to
dataset/train/38_80.wav|the extreme on all sides without shattering. It's the only thing holding this phone together
dataset/train/38_81.wav|cuz it sure is an Android. Well, Microsoft Surface Duo 2 has survived my durability test.
dataset/train/38_82.wav|I'm curious though, would you swap your Android phone for a dual screen full fledged pocket
dataset/train/38_83.wav|computer? Do you think Android is holding the Duo series back from something epic?
dataset/train/38_84.wav|Let me know your thoughts down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/38_85.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/39_1.wav|It's been brought to my attention with regards to my ant drawing, that ants in fact have 6
dataset/train/39_2.wav|legs and not 4. For this I apologize. A Bug's Life lied to me...and I should go outside more
dataset/train/39_3.wav|often. Now that I've remedied the situation and our ant has 6 legs, the entomologists
dataset/train/39_4.wav|should be satisfied and we can commence with the Pixel 6 Pro teardown. Let's get started.
dataset/train/39_5.wav|You might think that we would start on the back of the Pixel 6 Pro like other Android phones,
dataset/train/39_6.wav|but that's not the case this time around. Google has once again designed the Pixel 6 so that the
dataset/train/39_7.wav|screen comes off first. The phone is IP68 with plenty of adhesive around the edge. And with the
dataset/train/39_8.wav|tiny bezels, I'm taking extreme care to not poke the side of the AMOLED display under the glass
dataset/train/39_9.wav|because one poke would destroy the whole thing. Once the adhesive is sliced away on the one side,
dataset/train/39_10.wav|I can use my suction cup to pull away the glass
dataset/train/39_11.wav|and the whole phone opens up like a book. Under the one t4 screw is a single ribbon
dataset/train/39_12.wav|connecting the display to the body. I can pop that off just like a little Lego
dataset/train/39_13.wav|and the screen is free from the body. The Pixel 6 Pro display is definitely the easiest screen
dataset/train/39_14.wav|repair of 2021. With the right tools and pre-laid adhesive, I bet a repair
dataset/train/39_15.wav|tech could replace a broken screen in about 60 seconds. Nice work, Google. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/39_16.wav|Now you might be like, 'Hey Jerry, but what about that fingerprint scanner?' And you're
dataset/train/39_17.wav|correct. There is once attached to the screen, but luckily this isn't Apple we're talking about.
dataset/train/39_18.wav|And Google has provided a fingerprint calibration tool that can be used online if your screen ever
dataset/train/39_19.wav|does get replaced. Once again, nice work Google. The screen is still functioning.
dataset/train/39_20.wav|I think we should go deeper. There is a copious amount of black tape covering the battery and
dataset/train/39_21.wav|circuit board. I'm curious if this is here to help dissipate the heat out the front of the screen.
dataset/train/39_22.wav|We have two more t4 screws down at the bottom holding down the cutest little bracket over
dataset/train/39_23.wav|the charging port. This has a white water damage indicator on it so even though the phone is water
dataset/train/39_24.wav|resistant, this little sticker will turn pink to tattle on you if liquid ever does seep inside.
dataset/train/39_25.wav|We have 7 more t4 screws holding down the massive metal mid plate.
dataset/train/39_26.wav|This guy is pretty hefty and made with solid metal. I imagine these mid plates are what make
dataset/train/39_27.wav|the phone so heavy and keep it structurally solid. It also acts as a heat sink for the processor.
dataset/train/39_28.wav|There's another little guy up top. And finally, with those metal plates gone we can unplug the
dataset/train/39_29.wav|battery. The battery has a strange plastic pull tab on it. The adhesive underneath the battery is
dataset/train/39_30.wav|still far too strong for it to be removed with just a simple pull. So maybe this pull strip
dataset/train/39_31.wav|is supposed to help slice through the adhesive. Or maybe it's only meant to be lifted up on after the
dataset/train/39_32.wav|isopropyl alcohol soaks the adhesive underneath. Cuz the ribbon itself isn't very strong.
dataset/train/39_33.wav|I'll drip some isopropyl alcohol underneath the battery to dissolve that adhesive
dataset/train/39_34.wav|while we take a look at this absolute unit of a camera unit.
dataset/train/39_35.wav|Apparently the massive camera bump isn't just for aesthetics since the cameras really do take up
dataset/train/39_36.wav|all that space inside of the phone. We have the 50 megapixel main camera over here on the left
dataset/train/39_37.wav|with OIS. Then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera which does not have OIS.
dataset/train/39_38.wav|Then on the right side we have the 48 megapixel 4x telescoping telephoto camera,
dataset/train/39_39.wav|which also has the internal optical stabilization. I took one of these apart in my Galaxy S20 Ultra
dataset/train/39_40.wav|video if you want to see how that works. I'll leave a link for that down in the description.
dataset/train/39_41.wav|Now that the alcohol's dissolved the adhesive, we can lift away the Pixel 6 Pro battery. It
dataset/train/39_42.wav|has a 5003 milliamp hour capacity. I'll remove 4 more screws up here at the top. And again up here
dataset/train/39_43.wav|we get another strange metal chunk. This would normally probably act as a heat sink for the 5G
dataset/train/39_44.wav|antenna. The 5G antenna is probably why the entire top of the phone is made from plastic...except
dataset/train/39_45.wav|that with previous 5G phones that I've opened up, my 5G antenna has always been attached to ribbon
dataset/train/39_46.wav|cables. And this one is just free floating. I did a bit more research and it turns out that my phone
dataset/train/39_47.wav|is an international variant which does not have the millimeter wave 5G. So this little guy is just
dataset/train/39_48.wav|an impostor that's shaped like a 5G antenna and taking up space. This is normal though. The phone
dataset/train/39_49.wav|can still be called 5G without the millimeter wave antennas. Not everywhere has those frequencies.
dataset/train/39_50.wav|The earpiece and microphone both have red rubber rings around the opening to help keep water out,
dataset/train/39_51.wav|along with these little foam balls. I'll unscrew 4 more t4 screws and remove the SIM card tray.
dataset/train/39_52.wav|And then we can get our first look at the Pixel 6 Pro's motherboard,
dataset/train/39_53.wav|which does have the front facing 11.1 megapixel selfie camera still attached.
dataset/train/39_54.wav|It's got the Lego-style connector, and of course, the USB-C port down here at the
dataset/train/39_55.wav|bottom which is soldered in place. It does have a cool blue rubber ring around the opening though.
dataset/train/39_56.wav|The last thing we have inside of the Pixel 6 Pro is the wireless charger, also hidden under a ton
dataset/train/39_57.wav|of graphite tape, but it's definitely back here. I imagine that the rear glass replacements of the
dataset/train/39_58.wav|Pixel 6 Pro are going to be rather difficult. But at least the screen is quick and easy.
dataset/train/39_59.wav|Now we just gotta see if everything still works when I put it all back together.
dataset/train/39_60.wav|Overall I'm pretty impressed with the Pixel 6 Pro. We learned quite a lot. The cameras are obviously
dataset/train/39_61.wav|a huge focus of the phone since they take up so much of the internal real estate. We also learned
dataset/train/39_62.wav|that Google has taken a few minutes to think about repairability which is awesome. We learned that
dataset/train/39_63.wav|ants have 6 legs. I'm still not quite sure what that battery pull tab was for though. But hey,
dataset/train/39_64.wav|maybe that's on me. I'll get the big metal plate situated back on the motherboard
dataset/train/39_65.wav|and get that single ribbon cable for the screen plugged in with it's metal bracket and screw.
dataset/train/39_66.wav|Once it's turned on our Pixel 6 Pro is as good as new. Of course though,
dataset/train/39_67.wav|if you want to see the insides of your own phone from the outsides,
dataset/train/39_68.wav|I do make it a whole lot easier with my Teardown Skin from dbrand. I think the camera hardware
dataset/train/39_69.wav|looks even more impressive when you can see how much space under the lens they are actually
dataset/train/39_70.wav|utilizing. Grab a Teardown Skin for your own device with the link in the description. Hit
dataset/train/39_71.wav|that subscribe button if you haven't already. And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/39_72.wav|Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.
dataset/train/4_1.wav|In front of us today we have a brand new 2022 iPad in pink. This is not to be confused, of course,
dataset/train/4_2.wav|with the iPad Pro, iPad Mini, iPad Air, or 9th Generation iPad, all of which are still for sale
dataset/train/4_3.wav|on Apple's website. These new iPads are the most colorful though. Today we're going to find out how
dataset/train/4_4.wav|durable this new iPad is. Speaking of colorful and durable, I have a JerryRig knife sale going on,
dataset/train/4_5.wav|that I'm probably going to regret later, for just $9.99. USPS says the last day to order something
dataset/train/4_6.wav|and have it still arrive by Christmas is December 17th. So the clock is ticking. I think the first
dataset/train/4_7.wav|colors that we're going to run out of are the Metal and Clear, so if you've been eyeing those,
dataset/train/4_8.wav|now is the time. And of course I will do my absolute best to get them to you by the holidays.
dataset/train/4_9.wav|If you do a lot of shipping like me, and if you hate leaving your house, like me,
dataset/train/4_10.wav|you're going to love today's sponsor, Stamps.com. For more than 20 years Stamps.com has been

dataset/train/4_20.wav|we get extremely up close and personal with Apple's new iPad. Let's get started.
dataset/train/4_21.wav|Your first question today is probably, 'Hey Jerry, what makes this iPad different from
dataset/train/4_22.wav|the other 4 iPads for sale on Apple's website?' And I'm going to be honest, they all kind of seem
dataset/train/4_23.wav|the same to me. But this one is pink and costs about $450, which doesn't seem all that bad.
dataset/train/4_24.wav|The pink is kind of a softer peachy pink in my opinion. Inside the box we have a pretty
dataset/train/4_25.wav|high quality charging cable. A charging brick. And if we look close we can check the wattage.
dataset/train/4_26.wav|Sorry. If we look close we can check the wattage. It looks like 20 watts...and holy cannoli,
dataset/train/4_27.wav|both ends of this cable are USB-C. The new iPad 10th Generation has officially caught up with
dataset/train/4_28.wav|the rest of the world and is using USB-C. Nice work, Apple. Hopefully that means that iPhones
dataset/train/4_29.wav|are next to transition, which I'm betting they'll have to to comply with the new EU regulations.
dataset/train/4_30.wav|The most difficult part of this transition, of course,
dataset/train/4_31.wav|will be the accessories we lose along the way. For example, this 10th Generation iPad is compatible
dataset/train/4_32.wav|with the 1st Generation Apple pencil, but not the wirelessly charging 2nd Generation pencil.
dataset/train/4_33.wav|Which means if you do get the 1st Gen pencil with it's lightning port eraser,
dataset/train/4_34.wav|you'll have to buy the $9 Apple pencil adapter which then plugs into a USB-C cable,
dataset/train/4_35.wav|which then plugs into the iPad to both pair and charge the Apple pencil. Lose any one of these
dataset/train/4_36.wav|three tiny components and your pencil will no longer function. Apple's loving it though. I hear
dataset/train/4_37.wav|they're even changing the catchphrase from “think different” to “think dongle.” We'll get this
dataset/train/4_38.wav|little menage a trois out of the way and get down to analyzing the color a little more thoroughly.
dataset/train/4_39.wav|It's not a bad pink. A little less vibrant than my knife but also not quite as Bubble
dataset/train/4_40.wav|Gum as the lighter. But still loud enough to be noticed for sure. I don't hate it.
dataset/train/4_41.wav|Getting ready for the front screen scratch test I notice something interesting. We always set up
dataset/train/4_42.wav|for our Mohs scale of hardness, but this time around I can tell there is an air gap between
dataset/train/4_43.wav|the front glass and the display underneath. Not something we normally find. We can see the
dataset/train/4_44.wav|glass on top move independently from the pixels. We'll have to confirm this during the teardown,
dataset/train/4_45.wav|or you know, later on in this video if it does snap in half. All in good time of course.
dataset/train/4_46.wav|Plastic would scratch at a level 2 or 3. Glass scratches at a 5 or 6. And sapphire would scratch
dataset/train/4_47.wav|at a level 8 or 9. The free floating pane of glass however, starts scratching at level 6,
dataset/train/4_48.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7. Pretty standard. No complaints so far.
dataset/train/4_49.wav|Making our way up to the top front facing camera...which is no longer at the top. It's
dataset/train/4_50.wav|now tucked into the side bezel and protected by glass. It is a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera.
dataset/train/4_51.wav|I am a fan of this placement although I really don't have strong feelings one way or the other.
dataset/train/4_52.wav|The sides are made from anodized aluminum. 100% recycled aluminum to be exact. This iPad was
dataset/train/4_53.wav|maybe a Mountain Dew can in a previous life. And maybe it'll be a Mountain Dew
dataset/train/4_54.wav|can again in the next life...which will be coming pretty soon. The buttons are
dataset/train/4_55.wav|metal except for the top power button which doubles as a fingerprint scanner. It does not
dataset/train/4_56.wav|scratch. Thumbs up for that. On the opposite side of the camera we have more metal and
dataset/train/4_57.wav|three golden circles near the magnetical attachment point for the keyboard thing.
dataset/train/4_58.wav|At the bottom we have more speaker grills, and our good buddy, the USB-C port. Making
dataset/train/4_59.wav|our way to the back panel we have our 12 megapixel wide angle camera back here,
dataset/train/4_60.wav|along with a directional mic. And of course, the super shiney Apple logo, which does scratch.
dataset/train/4_61.wav|Now we know Apple has 5 iPads for sale right now.
dataset/train/4_62.wav|The iPad Pro hits that sweet demographic of people who like having the power of a laptop,
dataset/train/4_63.wav|and like paying extra for the keyboard. The iPad Air is for people who like the regular
dataset/train/4_64.wav|iPad but don't like going two dongles deep to get the Apple pencil working.
dataset/train/4_65.wav|Then, of course, this is the regular iPad.
dataset/train/4_66.wav|We also have last year's iPad 9th Gen which doesn't change all that much,
dataset/train/4_67.wav|and the iPad Mini which is the small one. I hope that cleared up any confusion. And
dataset/train/4_68.wav|even though my drawing is complete, I'm highly doubtful anyone can tell what it is.
dataset/train/4_69.wav|I'll be the first one to admit it's not my best work. I tried going for a cute little pink Kirby,
dataset/train/4_70.wav|but this one looks like he got tko'd on a 1v1 first m2k. Maybe we should just keep
dataset/train/4_71.wav|going with the durability test and put the nightmare Kirby behind us.
dataset/train/4_72.wav|Apple's calling the 10.9 inch screen a liquid retina display. And after about
dataset/train/4_73.wav|15 seconds from my lighter, we can see that the heat passing through the glass
dataset/train/4_74.wav|and air gap causes the LCD to go black. But after some time it does recover.
dataset/train/4_75.wav|At this point we would usually test the fingerprint scanner, but since it's
dataset/train/4_76.wav|unscratchable up here, there's no need. We can go straight to the bend test. You might be thinking
dataset/train/4_77.wav|that iPads are weak and of course they'll break, but in fact, the most recent iPad Pro survived,
dataset/train/4_78.wav|along with the older iPad Mini. It, too, survived the bend test. This iPad 10th Generation, however,
dataset/train/4_79.wav|should not be put in a back pocket. The Achilles heel of this tablet seems to be
dataset/train/4_80.wav|the three gold pads running along the side. Less material and less structure led to a
dataset/train/4_81.wav|catastrophic weak point and subsequent shattering. The other side of the tablet
dataset/train/4_82.wav|without the dots does not crack, even after it's been structurally compromised. So if
dataset/train/4_83.wav|the dots could be moved on the next iteration it would, indeed, become a stronger tablet.
dataset/train/4_84.wav|Kirby's still back here being absolutely terrifying.
dataset/train/4_85.wav|I think that since we have nothing left to lose it's time for a teardown.
dataset/train/4_86.wav|A little bit of heat can help soften the adhesive around the edges. And it looks
dataset/train/4_87.wav|like the top layer of laminated glass is indeed completely separate from the display underneath.
dataset/train/4_88.wav|The digitizer is not glued to the pixels. Speaking
dataset/train/4_89.wav|of pixels, the liquid retina, or LCD, makes some pretty cool designs as I peel it away
dataset/train/4_90.wav|from the tablet. Bright flashes of light and color. It's gleaming it's last gleam.
dataset/train/4_91.wav|To be fair though this iPad does look pretty repairable. And from the inside this iPad
dataset/train/4_92.wav|tension looks a whole lot emptier than I was expecting. The motherboard is over here
dataset/train/4_93.wav|on the right side with some stylish aesthetic black lettering on the 28.9 watt hour battery.
dataset/train/4_94.wav|The biggest surprise though is that there are only 2 little tiny speakers in here. The iPad
dataset/train/4_95.wav|Pro has 4 speakers inside positioned close to their corresponding grill holes. But this
dataset/train/4_96.wav|particular speaker here at the bottom isn't even close to the opening. It's
dataset/train/4_97.wav|still stereo of course but there's a whole lot of empty space inside of this thing.
dataset/train/4_98.wav|The metal squares you're seeing are magnets, probably to help keep the
dataset/train/4_99.wav|folio cover closed. It's cool to see the magnets on the side labeled with their pole orientation
dataset/train/4_100.wav|to help keep the keyboard locked into place. Apple is using 100% recycled magnets for this,
dataset/train/4_101.wav|along with recycled tin, gold, and copper on the motherboard. I'm a fan of that.
dataset/train/4_102.wav|I'm not, however, a fan of nightmare Kirby back here. Luckily he can be gone forever with one of
dataset/train/4_103.wav|my Teardown Skins which lets you see the exact layout of all the internal components without
dataset/train/4_104.wav|ever needing to snap your tablet in half, which is probably preferable to most parents out there.
dataset/train/4_105.wav|Let's just all agree to never talk about Kirby again.
dataset/train/4_106.wav|Grab your discounted JerryRig knife with the link in the description. They make excellent
dataset/train/4_107.wav|stocking stuffers. Just make sure to keep track of those fingers – Santa can't replace digits.
dataset/train/4_108.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram. Thanks a ton for watching. And I'll see you around.
dataset/train/40_1.wav|The Pixel 6 Pro. Many reviewers online will talk about software,
dataset/train/40_2.wav|and to be honest, that is what Google is good at, but only a few reviewers will
dataset/train/40_3.wav|talk about how phones are built and what they are made of. That's where I come in.
dataset/train/40_4.wav|Today we'll be assessing the durability and structural integrity of the Pixel 6
dataset/train/40_5.wav|Pro – Google's latest flagship smartphone. Should be interesting. Let's get started.
dataset/train/40_6.wav|Right off the bat, the biggest visual distinction between this and other smartphones
dataset/train/40_7.wav|is the massive Geordi-esque Star Trek style visor on the back, with a huge protrusion lengthwise
dataset/train/40_8.wav|across the entire surface. For Americans, the raised lip is a little thicker than a quarter.
dataset/train/40_9.wav|About the same thickness as an SD card, or very similar in thickness to a strand of spaghetti.
dataset/train/40_10.wav|For everyone else in the world, it's 2.5 millimeters. I've mentioned previously that
dataset/train/40_11.wav|I feel like smartphones internally are mostly the same these days,
dataset/train/40_12.wav|and that remains true for the Pixel 6 Pro as well...with a few caveats.
dataset/train/40_13.wav|Google's software is what makes this phone different. It's live captions, live transcribe,
dataset/train/40_14.wav|and live language translation features are mind bogglingly good. Plus, you know how you feel
dataset/train/40_15.wav|like your phone's always listening and giving ads for stuff you only mentioned verbally to friends?
dataset/train/40_16.wav|Well now Google has managed to turn that creepiness into a marketing bullet point
dataset/train/40_17.wav|with something called Now Playing, which turns on your phone's microphones all day and identifies
dataset/train/40_18.wav|songs for you that are playing nearby. Who needs conspiracy theories when reality is right here?
dataset/train/40_19.wav|Enough with the software though, let's get back to the hardware.
dataset/train/40_20.wav|The nice thing about the camera bridge across the whole back panel is that there is zero rocking
dataset/train/40_21.wav|when it's laid flat. I like that. Plastic is a level two or three. Glass is a five or six,
dataset/train/40_22.wav|and sapphire is a level eight or nine. The Pixel 6 Pro starts seeing scratches at a level six,
dataset/train/40_23.wav|with deeper grooves at a level seven. Google is using Gorilla Glass Victus for the display, which
dataset/train/40_24.wav|means that the 11.1 megapixel front facing hole punch camera is also protected from scratches.
dataset/train/40_25.wav|The earpiece slit up top is super thin without any grills to fall out or get dirty. If you
dataset/train/40_26.wav|remember last year, the Pixel 5 was made with some strange plastic coated metal stuff. But this year
dataset/train/40_27.wav|we get solid metal, at least on this side. We have metal volume rockers and a metal power button.
dataset/train/40_28.wav|Surprisingly though, the top edge of the phone is 100% plastic across the entire edge.
dataset/train/40_29.wav|This is something we've never seen before. Usually all the sides on a smartphone are made from the
dataset/train/40_30.wav|same material. I imagine that this plastic might have something to do with the 5G antenna location,
dataset/train/40_31.wav|but we won't know for sure until we take it apart.
dataset/train/40_32.wav|Along the left side Google switches back to metal,
dataset/train/40_33.wav|including the IP67 SIM card tray, which has room for a single SIM card. No expandable memory. The
dataset/train/40_34.wav|bottom edge of the phone is also back to metal with it's USB-C port and pretty big
dataset/train/40_35.wav|slots for the loudspeaker and lower microphone. Three of the four sides are made from metal,
dataset/train/40_36.wav|and one side is made from plastic. We'll see if that affects the structure later on.
dataset/train/40_37.wav|The back of the phone is made with glass. This is the Stormy Black color with two slightly different
dataset/train/40_38.wav|shades of gray on either side of the camera ridge. The cameras, starting with a 50 megapixel main
dataset/train/40_39.wav|camera, 12 megapixel ultra wide, and 48 megapixel 4x telephoto lens, along with the laser auto focus
dataset/train/40_40.wav|and dual LED flash are all protected under a layer of glass. The sides of the camera hump though
dataset/train/40_41.wav|are made with a scratchable plastic. Fun fact, did you know that there are 1 million billion
dataset/train/40_42.wav|ants alive on earth right now? I'm not sure whose job it is to count them all. Nobody mentioned ant
dataset/train/40_43.wav|counting during career day at my high school, but that is a lot of ants. The Pixel 6 Pro has
dataset/train/40_44.wav|a 6.7 inch 1440p 120 hertz display, and some phones survive the burn test with no damage,
dataset/train/40_45.wav|but the Pixel's pixels on the Pixel 6 Pro go lava red and then black after only about
dataset/train/40_46.wav|15 seconds...and stay that way, which just solidifies even further my resounding agreement
dataset/train/40_47.wav|that the burn test remains inconsequential. We'll keep doing it though just to make sure.
dataset/train/40_48.wav|Before the bend test, our Pixel 6 Pro does have an underscreen optical fingerprint reader. It's
dataset/train/40_49.wav|rather quick on the setup, and once my fingerprint is registered we can add some spaghetti...I mean,
dataset/train/40_50.wav|level 7 deeper grooves, and see if the scanner can still read my fingerprint through the heavily
dataset/train/40_51.wav|scratched glass. It got things right the majority of the time, even with the damage,
dataset/train/40_52.wav|which is good. Under screen fingerprint readers though are still just not my favorite.
dataset/train/40_53.wav|One thing I am nervous about though is the large camera bump that's basically separating the phones
dataset/train/40_54.wav|into two halves. It might make the perfect creasing point for the phone to just snap in
dataset/train/40_55.wav|half during the bend test. Starting the bend from the back though, we do get the smallest of flexes.
dataset/train/40_56.wav|And flipping it around to the front we get basically the same result.
dataset/train/40_57.wav|The Pixel 6 Pro doesn't seem very structurally affected by that large cross panel camera bump.
dataset/train/40_58.wav|The build is solid with no cracks, bends, or kinks. It did get burned easier than most
dataset/train/40_59.wav|smartphones and has the weird plastic rail up top, but other than that, I'd say the Pixel 6 Pro is a
dataset/train/40_60.wav|solid phone and passes my durability test. As a fun little bonus, here's a sneak peek of the
dataset/train/40_61.wav|insides with my Teardown Skin from dbrand. There are a lot of good looking phones internally this
dataset/train/40_62.wav|year, plus with a grip case, it flushes out the surface of that camera ridge perfectly.
dataset/train/40_63.wav|It makes the whole phone look like a cybernetic masterpiece. I'll show you more of the insides
dataset/train/40_64.wav|during the teardown video, but until then, you can grab a Teardown Skin for your own device with
dataset/train/40_65.wav|the link down in the description. If you have any questions, leave them down in the comments. Come
dataset/train/40_66.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/41_1.wav|Today we're going to be tearing down what's probably my favorite phone so far this year – the
dataset/train/41_2.wav|Z Flip 3. Normally, when we do a teardown on a folding phone it doesn't survive because
dataset/train/41_3.wav|the folding plastic screen isn't as durable as glass screens. But this time around I think it
dataset/train/41_4.wav|would be fun to try to keep it alive, even if it doesn't actually happen. Fun little side note,
dataset/train/41_5.wav|I will be getting my next shipment of Jerry Rig Knives. I know that supply shortages have affected
dataset/train/41_6.wav|everyone across the board including these. So if you're looking to snag one for yourself,
dataset/train/41_7.wav|or give away one for Christmas, I will leave a link down in the video description.
dataset/train/41_8.wav|And as soon as they arrive I will ship them out with Stamps.com. Huge thanks to Stamps.com for
dataset/train/41_9.wav|sponsoring this video. I use Stamps.com for all my shipping because it brings the services of
dataset/train/41_10.wav|the United States Postal Service and UPS right to my computer. So if you regularly send letters or
dataset/train/41_11.wav|packages for your business or side hustle, like me, it only takes a few minutes to get set up.
dataset/train/41_12.wav|And since 1998, over 1 million businesses, like mine, have been using Stamps.com.
dataset/train/41_13.wav|It's just nice not to have to stand in line at the post office. And I can ship everything I need to
dataset/train/41_14.wav|from my own computer. You can quickly compare carriers to get the best rates with Stamps.com's
dataset/train/41_15.wav|new rate adviser tool. And then I can just drop off my packages or schedule a pick up.
dataset/train/41_16.wav|Pretty simple. No lines or traffic. To get your free 4 week trial, free postage,
dataset/train/41_17.wav|discounted shipping and a free 5 pound digital scale, just head to Stamps.com/jerryrig
dataset/train/41_18.wav|and I'll leave a link down in the description. There are no long term commitments or contracts
dataset/train/41_19.wav|so it's a win-win for everyone. That link is down in the description Stamps.com/jerryrig.
dataset/train/41_20.wav|And now it's time to see if the Galaxy Fold 3 can survive an autopsy. Let's get started.
dataset/train/41_21.wav|The goal here this time around is to have a working Galaxy Flip 3
dataset/train/41_22.wav|after it gets 100% entirely disassembled, which means we're also removing that flexible screen.
dataset/train/41_23.wav|We've never ended up with a working folding phone after a teardown
dataset/train/41_24.wav|because in the past there was always something new and exciting on the screen hardware to check out,
dataset/train/41_25.wav|but this time around it's worth a shot...even if the attempt might be futile. We'll start from the
dataset/train/41_26.wav|back this time around with my heat gun. And also, not sure when this happened but my camera lens has
dataset/train/41_27.wav|cracked at some point between my durability test and now. Maybe one of the bends stressed out the
dataset/train/41_28.wav|lens enough to crack. I'm not really sure because it definitely hasn't been dropped.
dataset/train/41_29.wav|The lower glass is easy enough to be removed. I did, however, forget that the top glass had a full
dataset/train/41_30.wav|screen underneath and I did nick that with my pry tool as I was slicing the adhesive off from around
dataset/train/41_31.wav|the edges. But it looks like things are still working, even if that display is a little dinged.
dataset/train/41_32.wav|The camera is still working even when the display is separated from the body. Kind of trippy. I'll
dataset/train/41_33.wav|get everything turned off again and we can press forward with a little more caution.
dataset/train/41_34.wav|The smaller rear LCD is attached to the Flip 3 with it's own Lego-style ribbon connector.
dataset/train/41_35.wav|And interestingly enough, the black and colored halves of the Flip 3 are actually one solid
dataset/train/41_36.wav|piece of glass. For some reason I thought they would be two. So far things are looking good.
dataset/train/41_37.wav|I'll remove the two screws holding down the metal plate over the upper battery connection.
dataset/train/41_38.wav|Then I can unplug that battery just like a little Lego and then we can move down
dataset/train/41_39.wav|to the bottom half of the phone which has the wireless charger. It's connectors are
dataset/train/41_40.wav|held in place by another metal bracket with two more screws.
dataset/train/41_41.wav|The wireless coil can then be removed, and the lower larger battery can be unplugged. The Flip
dataset/train/41_42.wav|3 does have 5G with two of it's little millimeter wave antennas tucked into the side rail,
dataset/train/41_43.wav|and another near the hinge. The funny thing about technology is that the more it improves,
dataset/train/41_44.wav|the crazier people get who don't understand how it works, while, of course, they're still using
dataset/train/41_45.wav|it. People are saying the same things about 5G as they said about 4G, and 3G. But the truth is,
dataset/train/41_46.wav|as long as you aren't sticking your head in a microwave, you'll be just fine.
dataset/train/41_47.wav|Where was I? Oh yeah. The balls. Inside the loudspeaker we have the same foam dampening
dataset/train/41_48.wav|balls that we find in most high end cell phones, including the iPhones. There is no waterproofing
dataset/train/41_49.wav|on the unit itself, but there is some down on the frame that I'll show you in a second.
dataset/train/41_50.wav|I can unclip the folding display ribbon. And then down here are the little ingress
dataset/train/41_51.wav|protection screens to help keep the water out of the loudspeaker and microphone holes.
dataset/train/41_52.wav|The Flip 3 is ipx8 water resistant just like the Fold. To get the battery out, Samsung is still
dataset/train/41_53.wav|making things difficult with permanently glued in batteries. This is annoying for multiple reasons,
dataset/train/41_54.wav|but mainly because it makes the phone much more difficult to recycle at the end of its lifespan.
dataset/train/41_55.wav|As of now, lithium batteries are 95% recyclable, but with each additional removal process,
dataset/train/41_56.wav|the likelihood of it actually getting recycled goes down. All 2,370 milliamp hours of it.
dataset/train/41_57.wav|The charging port does separate from its ribbon cable. It's plugged in on the underside,
dataset/train/41_58.wav|and it's got a red rubber ring around the opening.
dataset/train/41_59.wav|The other motherboard has several extension ribbons going through the hinge, along with 6
dataset/train/41_60.wav|more silver screws holding down the top plastics. But even after getting all those screws out, there
dataset/train/41_61.wav|is still something holding the motherboard in place. Ah yes. My old nemesis – the SIM card tray.
dataset/train/41_62.wav|Finally, with the motherboard out, we can see the top 12 megapixel ultra wide camera up top,
dataset/train/41_63.wav|with no optical image stabilization. Then we have the main 12 megapixel camera right below that,
dataset/train/41_64.wav|which does have the OIS. And both of these cameras can be disconnected from
dataset/train/41_65.wav|the motherboard with their Lego-style connectors. There is another battery in the top half of the
dataset/train/41_66.wav|phone. I imagine that this battery is less out of convenience and more there to balance out
dataset/train/41_67.wav|the weight of the two halves, since having one half of the phone entirely made for batteries
dataset/train/41_68.wav|would throw the balance out of whack. So Samsung put this 930 milliamp hour
dataset/train/41_69.wav|capacity battery in the top half so it doesn't yeet itself to the ground with each unfolding.
dataset/train/41_70.wav|With everything out of the phone, the only thing we have left to do is remove the foldable dynamic
dataset/train/41_71.wav|120 hertz AMOLED with HDR 10 plus and 1200 nits. I might be stalling a bit but check out this
dataset/train/41_72.wav|waterproofing along the ribbons inside the hinge. The top portion has a red rubber sealant, while
dataset/train/41_73.wav|the bottom hinge has more of a gray color. Kind of cool that Samsung's being all color coordinated on
dataset/train/41_74.wav|the inside. Okay, fine, let's do it. I feel like this is a slow motion murder, but we can't tell
dataset/train/41_75.wav|when it actually dies since the screen is off. Luckily for us the plastic bezel that protects
dataset/train/41_76.wav|the edge of the screen is relatively easy to pop off. As we know from previous Fold teardowns,
dataset/train/41_77.wav|an accidental poke to the side of the screen will kill it. Samsung has included a metal plate along
dataset/train/41_78.wav|the back side of the display which hopefully should allow this to lift up on the pixels
dataset/train/41_79.wav|without damaging them. And I can take special care as we pry along the screen so that once
dataset/train/41_80.wav|we reach the bottom we won't damage the screen ribbon cable as we pull it out from the frame.
dataset/train/41_81.wav|The screen is much less floppy than I anticipated. It naturally just wants to sit at this slightly
dataset/train/41_82.wav|kinked angle. Along where it rests on the hinge, there are still metal slats integrated into the
dataset/train/41_83.wav|display. We've seen these on previous versions of the Fold. And unfortunately it looks like we might
dataset/train/41_84.wav|have inflicted some damage along the bottom edge of the screen. But fingers crossed it might just
dataset/train/41_85.wav|be the black protective covering on top. It looks like it's been torn a little by the adhesive.
dataset/train/41_86.wav|Before we find out how murdered the phone is though, let's take a look at the internal hinge.
dataset/train/41_87.wav|Peeling back the adhesive liner exposes the complex inner workings of the multi positional
dataset/train/41_88.wav|masterpiece. Once again, I'm mostly stalling. You should leave your survival predictions down in
dataset/train/41_89.wav|the comments. I can pretend that the phone is still alive as long as I don't actually check
dataset/train/41_90.wav|it's vital signs. Personally, I give it about a negative 12% chance of surviving with how fragile
dataset/train/41_91.wav|that screen is. With the battery back in place, along with a charge port and bottom loudspeaker,
dataset/train/41_92.wav|we can move up to the top battery. I'll slide the motherboard back into its slot and plug in
dataset/train/41_93.wav|the extension ribbons. The final plastics are in place, along with the sneaky SIM card tray.
dataset/train/41_94.wav|And last but not least, the metal brackets that keep all the connectors connected. I'll plug in
dataset/train/41_95.wav|the rear display, press the power button, and would you look at that - success. Both screens
dataset/train/41_96.wav|are still functioning and the phone is powered on. Basically pretty much just like new...maybe
dataset/train/41_97.wav|slightly used. It's kind of been through a lot but you know, we don't judge.
dataset/train/41_98.wav|I'm very surprised it's still functioning. Obviously though, the easiest way to see the
dataset/train/41_99.wav|insides of your phone from the outside is with one of my Teardown Skins. The Fold 3
dataset/train/41_100.wav|is quite honestly one of the best looking Teardown Skins of all time – especially
dataset/train/41_101.wav|with the copper wireless charging pad. It doesn't get much more futuristic than that.
dataset/train/41_102.wav|Maybe it is, you know, still a little floppy, but I consider this an absolute win. Nice work,
dataset/train/41_103.wav|Samsung. And nice work myself. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/41_104.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/42_1.wav|The Nintendo Switch OLED edition. Nintendo has never been one to rush into things.
dataset/train/42_2.wav|Yeah, Xbox and PlayStation might have already come out with all new gaming systems,
dataset/train/42_3.wav|but Nintendo has a little more old school 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' vibe.
dataset/train/42_4.wav|They have, however, decided to grace us with an all new larger OLED display.
dataset/train/42_5.wav|And it's time to see if it's durable. Let's get started.
dataset/train/42_6.wav|It's always a better idea for me to test the durability of a device on purpose
dataset/train/42_7.wav|so you won't have to find out the hard way on accident.
dataset/train/42_8.wav|It might also be my imagination, but right out of the box, this new Nintendo Switch feels heavier.
dataset/train/42_9.wav|There's also a new full fledged flap of a kickstand traversing the back panel.
dataset/train/42_10.wav|Already a substantial improvement over the previous toothpick of a kickstand.
dataset/train/42_11.wav|The new OLED screen is slightly larger than the old LCD version by almost a full inch, kind of
dataset/train/42_12.wav|nice. The 7 inch display is still capped at 720p while playing in handheld mode. And 1080p when
dataset/train/42_13.wav|docked up to a TV. Same as it was when the Switch was originally released four and a half years ago.
dataset/train/42_14.wav|And I don't want to sound bitter or anything, but Nintendo could have probably saved the planet by
dataset/train/42_15.wav|dropping Breath of the Wild 2 in 2020...or at least saved everyone from boredom If we really
dataset/train/42_16.wav|wanted people to stay home for long periods of time, they should have released that game.
dataset/train/42_17.wav|Now it is possible to make OLED displays from plastic like we saw on the Z Fold.
dataset/train/42_18.wav|But usually small OLED screens like we see on cell phones have a layer of glass on top.
dataset/train/42_19.wav|And with this Switch's subtle weight gain, glass is what I'm hoping for. We can lay out the Mohs
dataset/train/42_20.wav|scale of hardness which helps us differentiate between different materials. Levels 2 and 3 would
dataset/train/42_21.wav|by plastic. 5 or 6 would be glass. And level 8 or 9 would be sapphire. If we ever get a
dataset/train/42_22.wav|Switch with a level 10 diamond screen, well, it'll probably cost more than $350. But unfortunately,
dataset/train/42_23.wav|what we're seeing here are scratches at a level 3, with deeper grooves at a level 4, which means
dataset/train/42_24.wav|this new OLED screen has a surface layer of plastic. Looks like my battery's a little low.
dataset/train/42_25.wav|Fun side note, if your Switch ever needs a little juice on the go,
dataset/train/42_26.wav|whatever power bank you decide to use needs to have a power delivery function.
dataset/train/42_27.wav|The PD standard is the only one that can charge up the Switch while playing it.
dataset/train/42_28.wav|Everything else might still work and give the Switch some juice, it'll just be way slower. My
dataset/train/42_29.wav|channel sponsor, Anker, has one of these for like $30. I'll link down in the description.
dataset/train/42_30.wav|Where were we? Oh yeah, plastic screens. Just, you know, once again it's good to know that the
dataset/train/42_31.wav|OLED screen is soft so that we can avoid putting it in situations where it can be damaged by coins
dataset/train/42_32.wav|or keys, or other metal objects. Nintendo has said that the screen itself is made from glass,
dataset/train/42_33.wav|and that this plastic film which feels very permanent is an anti-scattering adhesive layer,
dataset/train/42_34.wav|which is there to help keep the glass shards from scattering if the display ever does
dataset/train/42_35.wav|shatter. Kind of like the laminated glass on a vehicle windshield and it is probably
dataset/train/42_36.wav|a good thing to have. If you really do want that glass feeling though, and make your
dataset/train/42_37.wav|Switch more resilient. Dbrand does have a glass screen protector that's pretty easy to install,
dataset/train/42_38.wav|and it sits perfectly inside this little outer bezel. It's almost like the Switch was made for
dataset/train/42_39.wav|this extra layer. However, if you really want the protection of glass but the feeling of plastic,
dataset/train/42_40.wav|you can always put another plastic screen protector over the top of your glass screen
dataset/train/42_41.wav|protector. And you can protect that protector with another protector...and that protector
dataset/train/42_42.wav|with another protector...and that protector with another protector. It's like a glass and plastic
dataset/train/42_43.wav|sandwich that just keeps going indefinitely. Kind of like our wait for Breath of the Wild 2.
dataset/train/42_44.wav|After about 40 layers or so, the optical clarity starts to become sub-par, but my
dataset/train/42_45.wav|Switch is pretty super protected. Pretty sure I now have the most protected Switch on the planet.
dataset/train/42_46.wav|I've just exponentially upgraded Nintendo's glass and plastic sandwich. I'm mostly kidding about the
dataset/train/42_47.wav|mile high screen protector thing. But dbrand's glass really does take things to the next level,
dataset/train/42_48.wav|especially when somehow they've managed to have the glass layer on the outside
dataset/train/42_49.wav|so it feels nice, while if it ever does break, the shards still stay connected.
dataset/train/42_50.wav|Science. Nintendo's probably taking notes. I'll leave a link for these down in the description.
dataset/train/42_51.wav|Now for the joy-cons Nintendo has said that these joy-cons are unchanged from the original version,
dataset/train/42_52.wav|but then they've also said that they have changed them up a bit. So I'm not sure which is true. The
dataset/train/42_53.wav|buttons are made from plastic and still have the lettering inlaid all the way through the
dataset/train/42_54.wav|button itself – not just printed on top. I can slice the top of the letter X off entirely,
dataset/train/42_55.wav|and the X still remains. Part of my letter X is gone, and now I can give it to you. X
dataset/train/42_56.wav|gon' give it to ya for sure. The attention to detail and quality is pretty impressive.
dataset/train/42_57.wav|Down below the letter buttons we have the joy stick which is still coated in a thick layer
dataset/train/42_58.wav|of rubber, and from a durability perspective externally, it seems super solid. It's the
dataset/train/42_59.wav|internal durability of these joy cons though that still remains to be seen...if ya catch my drift.
dataset/train/42_60.wav|The joy con housing is made from plastic.
dataset/train/42_61.wav|What's not plastic, however, is the border around the edge of the screen.
dataset/train/42_62.wav|Nintendo has finally incorporated metal into the Switch design.
dataset/train/42_63.wav|Super glad they did this since four years ago during the same test,
dataset/train/42_64.wav|one of the joy cons did snap off. It gives me some hope that maybe this OLED Switch will survive.
dataset/train/42_65.wav|Flipping the Switch over, here on the back we have the super large full length,
dataset/train/42_66.wav|multipositional kickstand. Above that kickstand is still plastic. But the kickstand itself –
dataset/train/42_67.wav|metal. Yeah, this Switch might cost $50 more than the original Switch did 4 years ago, but
dataset/train/42_68.wav|with this OLED screen and new metal components, I think that price increase is totally justified.
dataset/train/42_69.wav|Can't let a metal surface pass by without an Art Class with Jerry.
dataset/train/42_70.wav|As soon as you can tell what I'm drawing, let me know down in the comments. This one's a tough one.
dataset/train/42_71.wav|Not many people are going to get it. People have always asked me where I learned to draw so good,
dataset/train/42_72.wav|asking questions like, 'Hey Jerry, did you study with Van Gogh or Picasso?'
dataset/train/42_73.wav|And no, I didn't. I just, like, practice a lot.
dataset/train/42_74.wav|Like yeah, you see the finished product and are super proud of my effort,
dataset/train/42_75.wav|but what you don't see is how many OLED Switches I had to go through to perfect this drawing.
dataset/train/42_76.wav|Where do you think I got all those screen protectors? Practice makes perfect my friends.
dataset/train/42_77.wav|The internal fan has kicked on, probably because we are still charging,
dataset/train/42_78.wav|or maybe because my art is hot fire. I'm curious to see how many people can guess who this
dataset/train/42_79.wav|is. Let me know down in the comments. The kickstand itself is still very much attached
dataset/train/42_80.wav|to the Switch body and won't be falling off on it's own, just like the last one would,
dataset/train/42_81.wav|so that's pretty cool. I do gotta say though, that I'm a pretty big fan of the
dataset/train/42_82.wav|vibrance on this OLED panel. Me personally, I play my Switch docked 99% of the time,
dataset/train/42_83.wav|so I won't really ever get to enjoy this screen. But for someone who plays their Switch on the go,
dataset/train/42_84.wav|or undocked, this would be a pretty solid upgrade. OLED screens have more contrast
dataset/train/42_85.wav|between lights and darks and just have brighter colors in general which is great for video games.
dataset/train/42_86.wav|The screen did last for about 35 seconds under the heat from my lighter before the pixels turned
dataset/train/42_87.wav|white and did not recover. The plastic film on top, however, did not melt, which is interesting.
dataset/train/42_88.wav|If you remember four years ago, the whole screen was made from plastic and did melt quite a bit.
dataset/train/42_89.wav|I'll unplug Anker's power bank. We definitely have enough juice to finish the bend test.
dataset/train/42_90.wav|The top of the screen bezel is made from metal, but the rest of everything else though is plastic,
dataset/train/42_91.wav|like the buttons. Four years ago the weakest point in the Nintendo Switch was where the
dataset/train/42_92.wav|joy-cons joined with the body. This metal rail was screwed into some weaker metal
dataset/train/42_93.wav|and the screws just popped out with the threads they were attached to when the Switch was bent.
dataset/train/42_94.wav|The joy-cons themselves are made from plastic, but that's not the weak point. This year though it
dataset/train/42_95.wav|looks like the extra metal lip from the screen's bezel is supporting that rail. Things are looking
dataset/train/42_96.wav|quite a bit more rigid and stronger. The only way to know for sure though is with the bend test.
dataset/train/42_97.wav|There is still flex and all still mostly at the joint where the joy-cons join the body.
dataset/train/42_98.wav|Flipping it around to the back we see the same thing.
dataset/train/42_99.wav|The console itself though, the body, with this glass screen and long metal kickstand
dataset/train/42_100.wav|isn't bending at all. It might be game over for Link, but definitely not for the
dataset/train/42_101.wav|Switch. The Nintendo Switch OLED edition is solid. Nintendo has upgraded the screen and the structure
dataset/train/42_102.wav|and I'm impressed. Would I go out and buy a whole new Switch if my current Switch was working fine?
dataset/train/42_103.wav|I don't know, that's hard to say. With all the structural improvements though and the nicer
dataset/train/42_104.wav|OLED screen, I am surprised that the price only jumped by $50. Nice work, Nintendo.
dataset/train/42_105.wav|The only way it could be cooler is if we could see the insides from the outsides. Luckily,
dataset/train/42_106.wav|like always, I've got you covered with my Teardown Skin from dbrand.
dataset/train/42_107.wav|These are the exact internals of the joy-cons now displayed on the outside for our visual enjoyment.
dataset/train/42_108.wav|We have a Skin for the console as well, I just don't want to cover up my art just yet.
dataset/train/42_109.wav|As always, links are down in the description. What's your favorite game for this Switch?
dataset/train/42_110.wav|Let me know down in the comments. Personally, if you couldn't tell,
dataset/train/42_111.wav|I like Breath of the Wild. And that weird string flippy game that I forgot the name of.
dataset/train/42_112.wav|Unravel or something. That was fun. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/42_113.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter, and thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/43_1.wav|iPhones. Today in front of us we have the iPhone 13 Pro Max. And this is the part of
dataset/train/43_2.wav|the intro where I convince you that there's something super new and super cool inside
dataset/train/43_3.wav|to check out. Even though it suspiciously looks like an iPhone 12. Well, there's definitely
dataset/train/43_4.wav|something super new and cool to check out, that's for sure. And now you're wondering
dataset/train/43_5.wav|if that was a joke or if it's really true. Or maybe I'm just killing time because these
dataset/train/43_6.wav|phones are a royal pain to take apart. Let's get started.
dataset/train/43_7.wav|Let's be honest, Apple does some really good things like marketing or building ecosystems.
dataset/train/43_8.wav|But making their phones easy to repair is not one of them. In fact, Apple goes out of
dataset/train/43_9.wav|their way to make their phones hard to fix. It's like a really not fun game that Apple's
dataset/train/43_10.wav|been playing since day 1. And the people who lose are the customers and the planet. The
dataset/train/43_11.wav|iPhone 13 Pro Max has two pentalobe screws down at the bottom, just like usual. And then
dataset/train/43_12.wav|with heat and suction the screen can start to lift up and out of the stainless steel
dataset/train/43_13.wav|housing. This is much harder than it looks by the way, since the screen is flush with
dataset/train/43_14.wav|the frame. It's hard to get a good grip on that screen without breaking it, especially
dataset/train/43_15.wav|since glass is glass and we know what happens to glass. Keep in mind that if you ever crack
dataset/train/43_16.wav|the back glass on your iPhone 13 Pro Max, Apple will charge you $599 to replace it.
dataset/train/43_17.wav|Luckily, larger phone repair shops probably have a laser glass remover by now. So if you
dataset/train/43_18.wav|don't want to play Apple's game, or don't have insurance, you can always go with one
dataset/train/43_19.wav|of those.
dataset/train/43_20.wav|Now that we have the screen off, feel free to feast your eyes on these internals. It's
dataset/train/43_21.wav|interesting that Apple has taken time to print the A15 Bionic text on the motherboard, paying
dataset/train/43_22.wav|extra to print in a place that nobody is supposed to see, unless Apple's counting on people
dataset/train/43_23.wav|seeing it during my teardown, and by displaying that A15 Bionic branding, it brings awareness
dataset/train/43_24.wav|to Apple's proprietary chip manufacturing capability to millions of people using my
dataset/train/43_25.wav|videos, which they hate, to their own advantage. Well played, Tim, well played.
dataset/train/43_26.wav|I'll check the screen to make sure we didn't' toast anything. Out of warranty screen repairs
dataset/train/43_27.wav|are about $329 from Apple, by the way. Like the back glass, it's priced in a way that
dataset/train/43_28.wav|will coerce customers into getting a new phone instead of just fixing their old one...Basically
dataset/train/43_29.wav|off setting all the eco-friendly progress Apple's made in other areas. Not my favorite.
dataset/train/43_30.wav|Right underneath the A15 Bionic (I fell for it), are three tri point screws holding down
dataset/train/43_31.wav|the metal plate over the battery connector. I'll unplug that battery, just like a little
dataset/train/43_32.wav|Lego, along with the screen ribbon. The top screen ribbon is held in place by two more
dataset/train/43_33.wav|uncommon tri point screws, and switching screwdriver bits another time, two more Phillips head
dataset/train/43_34.wav|screws. We have currently used three different screwdriver bits on 9 screws. See what I mean
dataset/train/43_35.wav|by Apple making this difficult. If you don't keep your screws organized, it's game over.
dataset/train/43_36.wav|With the display removed, the screen is actually pretty thin. Apple's still using the OLED
dataset/train/43_37.wav|display on these new phones. They are calling it super retina. The ribbon cable on the top
dataset/train/43_38.wav|contains a microphone proximity sensor and light sensor up inside that top notch. The
dataset/train/43_39.wav|cameras and earpiece are still left inside of the phone body. Speaking of which, there
dataset/train/43_40.wav|are two more screws holding down a third metal plate just south of that A15 Bionic. East
dataset/train/43_41.wav|of the A15 Bionic we have a super large metal plate covering up the camera unit with it's
dataset/train/43_42.wav|5 screws. To keep the screws organized, I lay out the screws around the metal plates
dataset/train/43_43.wav|on my table and then just try not to sneeze for the rest of the repair. I'll get a close
dataset/train/43_44.wav|up shot of the insides of this iPhone 13 Pro Max. Feel free to bump up your resolution
dataset/train/43_45.wav|to 4K, screenshot this, crop it, and set it as the background of your phone. That way
dataset/train/43_46.wav|you too can advertise the A15 Bionic. I mean, to be fair, it does look pretty cool.
dataset/train/43_47.wav|Continuing on. There are two more Lego-style ribbon connectors in charge of the camera
dataset/train/43_48.wav|units. And this is where things have changed...ever so slightly...from last year's model. The
dataset/train/43_49.wav|sensors are slightly larger, taking up a good portion of the phone. And yeah, we have the
dataset/train/43_50.wav|12 megapixel three times telephoto lens, sticking up like Everest, with OIS. Then we have the
dataset/train/43_51.wav|12 megapixel ultrawide over here in the middle which does not have OIS. And finally, we have
dataset/train/43_52.wav|the 12 megapixel main camera here on the bottom, which Apple says has something called sensor
dataset/train/43_53.wav|shift OIS. But as you can clearly see, the lens itself is not moving. Instead of moving
dataset/train/43_54.wav|the camera lens like every other smartphone manufacturer goes with their cameras, Apple
dataset/train/43_55.wav|has decided to stabilize the internal sensor. Let me show you how that works. It might sound
dataset/train/43_56.wav|like I'm praising Apple here for a second, because I am, but I promise I'll keep it short.
dataset/train/43_57.wav|Like usual, all of the cameras are locked together inside of the same housing, which
dataset/train/43_58.wav|makes switching between all three perspectives in the camera app much faster and more seamless.
dataset/train/43_59.wav|But it also means we need to resort to catastrophic analysis to see what's going on.
dataset/train/43_60.wav|Quick question though, do you remember those old school Lego Bionicles? I'm not sure what
dataset/train/43_61.wav|reminded me of those. But anyway, back to the camera. With the rear removed so we see
dataset/train/43_62.wav|that sensor inside it's actually shifting around in the housing. The reason this is
dataset/train/43_63.wav|better or more efficient is that the sensor is much lighter than the lens. It weighs less
dataset/train/43_64.wav|so it's much easier to move around and therefore quicker. Apple's new sensor shift technology
dataset/train/43_65.wav|can stabilize an image 5x faster than regular lens optical image stabilization. Last year
dataset/train/43_66.wav|this tech was only available on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but this year Apple has applied
dataset/train/43_67.wav|the floating sensor tech to the main camera sensor of all 13 variants. You can see the
dataset/train/43_68.wav|four large magnets that manipulate the sensor inside of the lens. And on the sensor side
dataset/train/43_69.wav|are the little copper pads at each corner that can be moved by the magnetic field. Tiny,
dataset/train/43_70.wav|tiny tech, but makes for a pretty cool system. Large professional cameras have been using
dataset/train/43_71.wav|this kind of stabilization for a while now, like on the inside of my GH5. This is the
dataset/train/43_72.wav|same camera I used to film my videos with. The sensor moves around inside of the housing,
dataset/train/43_73.wav|and as far as I know, Apple is the only smartphone manufacturer to implement this style of stabilization
dataset/train/43_74.wav|into a smartphone. Nice work, Apple. Thumbs up for that. I'll put the sensor back into
dataset/train/43_75.wav|the lens. It'll be interesting to see if this thing still works when I put the whole thing
dataset/train/43_76.wav|back together again.
dataset/train/43_77.wav|One thing I'm pretty proud of actually is that we managed to incorporate that sensor
dataset/train/43_78.wav|shifting camera lens hardware into my Teardown Skin. And since the hardware exists in all
dataset/train/43_79.wav|iPhone 13 models, each one of them will have the copper accents around the main camera.
dataset/train/43_80.wav|I think we did a pretty good job. I'll put a link down in the description so you can
dataset/train/43_81.wav|grab a Teardown Skin for your own phone. Let's go deeper.
dataset/train/43_82.wav|To remove the motherboard, I'll unsnap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap,
dataset/train/43_83.wav|snap off 10 more ribbon cables. Just like an entire box of Legos. Pop out the SIM card
dataset/train/43_84.wav|tray and remove two large standoff screws with our fourth screwdriver bit. And this
dataset/train/43_85.wav|is it. The entire brains of the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Double stacked soldered together
dataset/train/43_86.wav|motherboards. Super consolidated. For some reason I can't remember the name of Apple's
dataset/train/43_87.wav|processor though. I think it was B14 cryogenic. I'm not good with names...but wait, there's
dataset/train/43_88.wav|more. A fourth camera, a lidar camera, is also sitting inside of the massive rear camera
dataset/train/43_89.wav|lens. Apple mostly uses this guy for low light auto focusing. Up at the top of the phone
dataset/train/43_90.wav|we can remove three more screws, pop off a little metal thingy, and remove a fourth standoff.
dataset/train/43_91.wav|And then our loudspeaker is free, along with the front facing cameras that are tucked underneath
dataset/train/43_92.wav|that speaker. These cameras make up the face ID scanning stuff with a dot projector and
dataset/train/43_93.wav|infrared camera. The regular 12 megapixel front facing selfie camera does have electronic
dataset/train/43_94.wav|stabilization. Down at the bottom of the iPhone 13 we have 12 more screws. Once those are
dataset/train/43_95.wav|gone there's a piece of tape holding down the loudspeaker to the taptic engine. Apple's
dataset/train/43_96.wav|fancy word for vibrator that provides haptic feedback. I'll make a dedicated video about
dataset/train/43_97.wav|vibrators at some point in the future. This little guy actually does some pretty cool
dataset/train/43_98.wav|things.
dataset/train/43_99.wav|At first glance the iPhone 13 Pro doesn't appear to have any balls inside that bottom
dataset/train/43_100.wav|loudspeaker. But if you stab it in just the right place we can indeed see the little guys.
dataset/train/43_101.wav|These provide more surface area inside the speaker for the sound to reverberate off of,
dataset/train/43_102.wav|making the speaker sound larger than it actually is. The charging port ribbon is the last ribbon
dataset/train/43_103.wav|down here at the bottom of the phone. And if we count there are another 8 screws spread
dataset/train/43_104.wav|out all over, even sticking sideways into the frame. It's pretty crazy in here, so much
dataset/train/43_105.wav|so in fact that all of these little bumps on the charging port ribbon say 'Apple uses
dataset/train/43_106.wav|too many screws' in Chinese braille. It's funny cuz you don't know if I'm joking or
dataset/train/43_107.wav|not, and Tim Cook's probably going to go check.
dataset/train/43_108.wav|Finally, the battery.  Which does have magical pull tabs.
dataset/train/43_109.wav| Apple has expanded the battery capacity just slightly this year.
dataset/train/43_110.wav|And these pull tabs are the only repairable thing about this phone. Watch them be gone
dataset/train/43_111.wav|next year. With these two pull tabs pulled, we can lift up the battery to find two much
dataset/train/43_112.wav|smaller pull tabs up at the top, which we could have also enjoyed but I didn't see them.
dataset/train/43_113.wav|This year's iPhone 13 Pro Max has 4,325 milliamp hours. Pretty solid increase over last year's
dataset/train/43_114.wav|3,687. For reference, I still need about 6,000 of these batteries to match the capacity of
dataset/train/43_115.wav|the electric hummer I'm building. Finally, the last layer of coolness inside of the iPhone
dataset/train/43_116.wav|13 Pro Max is the wireless charging and magnets on the back. You can see the copper coils
dataset/train/43_117.wav|and outlines of the 20 magnets, and like, I don't want to show off, but it's all identically
dataset/train/43_118.wav|mirrored on my Teardown Skin from outside the phone. I'll throw down some double sided
dataset/train/43_119.wav|tape to keep the battery from jiggling around after it's put back together.
dataset/train/43_120.wav|Assembling this thing is basically exactly like the nightmare you'd expect it to be.
dataset/train/43_121.wav|While putting the bottom loudspeaker back into the phone I discovered that the balls
dataset/train/43_122.wav|are leaking everywhere. A little piece of tape will solve that problem. Another real
dataset/train/43_123.wav|problem though is that let's say you want to replace anything in here, the battery,
dataset/train/43_124.wav|the screen, or the cameras, you'll get perpetual warning messages saying that you're not using
dataset/train/43_125.wav|genuine Apple components, even if the components you used were harvested from a genuine Apple
dataset/train/43_126.wav|phone. Apple has tied every individual component to the phone it was created with, and with
dataset/train/43_127.wav|that capability is one step away from blocking all third party repairs, which is insane.
dataset/train/43_128.wav|No other industry is like this. I can change the tires on my car, or my windshield, my
dataset/train/43_129.wav|oil, alternator, or exhaust, or my graphics card in my computer, the memory sticks, or
dataset/train/43_130.wav|the colored fans. I can fix those things because I actually own them. But if I can't replace
dataset/train/43_131.wav|the components inside of my own iPhone without daddy Apple's permission, do I really own
dataset/train/43_132.wav|my iPhone? I think not. Apple still owns the iPhone you thought you paid for. Yeah, putting
dataset/train/43_133.wav|a case or screen protector on your phone can prolong its life and avoid paying Apple's
dataset/train/43_134.wav|exorbitant repair prices, but I think we can all agree it's a little messed up, especially
dataset/train/43_135.wav|when these phones are costing as much as my first car. Personally, I was able to harvest
dataset/train/43_136.wav|parts from a broken Note 10 Plus to keep my own phone around for a few more years. And
dataset/train/43_137.wav|Apple is doing everything they can to prevent that same situation with their phones. Apple
dataset/train/43_138.wav|sells about 200 million phones a year, so repairing them is a big deal. And yeah, they'd
dataset/train/43_139.wav|sell a few less if they allowed repairs, but it would be much better overall for your wallet
dataset/train/43_140.wav|and the planet if they did. It's hard to take any of Apple's environmental recycling progress
dataset/train/43_141.wav|seriously when they aren't doing the reducing and reusing parts first. The broken camera
dataset/train/43_142.wav|is in place, along with the screen. And all the metal plates are screwed down next to
dataset/train/43_143.wav|the A15 Bionic. And to everyone's surprise, including my own, everything still works.
dataset/train/43_144.wav|Sometimes you'll need to plug it in to get the screen to power up. Anker is the official
dataset/train/43_145.wav|charging partner of Jerry Rig Everything, so I use their fast chargers and cables. I'll
dataset/train/43_146.wav|get the two pentalobe screws back into the base of the phone. And even more surprising
dataset/train/43_147.wav|than the phone still turning on is that the bus setup module is actually still functioning,
dataset/train/43_148.wav|even after having ripped the sensor away from the lens. To double check, I can put my finger
dataset/train/43_149.wav|over the lowest lens, the one we destroyed, and it's still seeing my finger. Kind of mind
dataset/train/43_150.wav|blowing. The phone can definitely survive repairs if Apple would just let them happen.
dataset/train/43_151.wav|Have you ever repaired your own phone or had it repaired? Let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/43_152.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/43_153.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/44_1.wav|In honor of the new iPhone launching, I decided to write a little poem.
dataset/train/44_2.wav|Roses are red, violets are blue.
dataset/train/44_3.wav|The iPhone is new, and comes in blue.
dataset/train/44_4.wav|But I only have black. Thank you.
dataset/train/44_5.wav|I’ve been working on that one all pandemic.
dataset/train/44_6.wav|In front of us today we do have the new iPhone 13 Pro Max.
dataset/train/44_7.wav|Just another attempt from Apple to make fat stacks.
dataset/train/44_8.wav|We’re going to see if it cracks....but not with an axe, smacks, or acts of attacks.
dataset/train/44_9.wav|The first thing I have recognized is that Apple’s mechanized.
dataset/train/44_10.wav|A thin strip of paper for the seal, which for me has quite the appeal.
dataset/train/44_11.wav|By removing the exterior polyethylene to which the cardboard it previously clinged.
dataset/train/44_12.wav|Apple has eliminated 600 metric tons of plastic, to me, that’s fantastic.
dataset/train/44_13.wav|Single use plastics are trash in more ways than one,
dataset/train/44_14.wav|since the degrade takes 500 trips around the sun.
dataset/train/44_15.wav|I’m sure it’s mostly a move that improves Apple’s margins,
dataset/train/44_16.wav|but at least now we’ll have less garbage filling up grandkid’s gardens.
dataset/train/44_17.wav|Yeah, surprise, Apple did something that I hearted…
dataset/train/44_18.wav|it might be the last time though. Let’s get started.
dataset/train/44_19.wav|Another thing besides the packaging, including less plastic,
dataset/train/44_20.wav|is that there’s still no charging brick in the box. Apple says this is to reduce waste,
dataset/train/44_21.wav|which is totally valid, but I also think that Apple realized they couldn’t make a better charger
dataset/train/44_22.wav|than Anker’s so they just quit. The Anker Nano Pro is 45% smaller, looks better, and charges faster.
dataset/train/44_23.wav|With 20 watts it gets an iPhone to 50% charged in just 25 minutes.
dataset/train/44_24.wav|That’s why Anker is the official charging partner of Jerry Rig Everything.
dataset/train/44_25.wav|Inside this little brick are temperature sensors and a powerful turner chip
dataset/train/44_26.wav|that can adjust the current in real time for optimal charging.
dataset/train/44_27.wav|Anker’s Power IQ 3.0 charging does work with other USB-C smartphones as well, so I’ll leave a link
dataset/train/44_28.wav|down in the description if you need one for your own device. If you’re thinking to yourself that,
dataset/train/44_29.wav|‘Wow, this iPhone 13 looks just like the iPhone 12 (and the 11)’, you’re definitely not wrong.
dataset/train/44_30.wav|Apple probably noticed that people weren’t upgrading when there was only an S next to
dataset/train/44_31.wav|the number, so they’ve changed to counting up with a whole number each year even if the minor
dataset/train/44_32.wav|improvements are only letter S worthy. Can’t blame them though. They are our business after all,
dataset/train/44_33.wav|and they’ve tapped into the human psyche better than any other business on the planet.
dataset/train/44_34.wav|The $200 billion in cash that Apple keeps in the bank proves it.
dataset/train/44_35.wav|One thing that is impressive though, which last year's phone also has is the ceramic shield front
dataset/train/44_36.wav|glass. Yeah it still has scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7, but the level
dataset/train/44_37.wav|6 scratches are so faint compared to other phones it really makes me think that ceramic shield is a
dataset/train/44_38.wav|super solid improvement over normal tempered smartphone glass. It’s important to remember
dataset/train/44_39.wav|though that glass is glass, and glass can break no matter how many buzz words are added to the name.
dataset/train/44_40.wav|Apple would really rather you not protect your device since they make money selling new phones.
dataset/train/44_41.wav|But you can stick it to the man with a screen protector.
dataset/train/44_42.wav|It’s much easier to replace a scratched or broken screen protector than it is a whole iPhone
dataset/train/44_43.wav|display. I’ll leave a link for dbrand’s tempered glass screen protector down in the description,
dataset/train/44_44.wav|but since this is a durability test we can’t have any cheating.
dataset/train/44_45.wav|So I’ll remove that screen protector I just put on.
dataset/train/44_46.wav|One subtle design change that most people probably wouldn’t notice is that Apple has
dataset/train/44_47.wav|moved the earpiece up a little bit and stuck it to the frame of the phone instead of attached to the
dataset/train/44_48.wav|underside of the glass. This will definitely make the teardown a little easier. The little metal
dataset/train/44_49.wav|grill is super solid and won’t be falling out on it’s own. The sides of the iPhone 13 Pro Max
dataset/train/44_50.wav|are made from stainless steel, which at a Mohs 5, is a much harder material than aluminum,
dataset/train/44_51.wav|which is about a Mohs 3. The sound it makes is a little different as well.
dataset/train/44_52.wav|The power button is still metal, along with the top of the phone. It’s hard for
dataset/train/44_53.wav|my stainless steel razor blade to even bite into the stainless steel sides of the phone. I’m a fan.
dataset/train/44_54.wav|I like the metal mute switch over here on the side,
dataset/train/44_55.wav|as well as the metal volume buttons and metal SIM card tray.
dataset/train/44_56.wav|One thing that Apple doesn’t tell you though is how water resistant their phone really is.
dataset/train/44_57.wav|They say it’s IP68, yeah, but not all IP rated phones are created equal.
dataset/train/44_58.wav|My own phone for example, a Note 10 Plus, achieved an IP68 rating by sitting one and a
dataset/train/44_59.wav|half meters deep in water for 30 minutes, like most every other smartphone. Apple, however,
dataset/train/44_60.wav|leveled up by putting their phone 6 meters deep for that same 30 minutes - 4 times the depth
dataset/train/44_61.wav|that smartphones regularly get tested at. Next level and pretty impressive. Of course we still
dataset/train/44_62.wav|have the lightning port down here at the bottom, but thanks to new UK regulations we should start
dataset/train/44_63.wav|seeing USB-C here pretty soon. The UK has now standardized cellphone ports across the board.
dataset/train/44_64.wav|I do like the textured back glass.
dataset/train/44_65.wav|And finally, the camera, another thing that Apple has incrementally updated this year.
dataset/train/44_66.wav|I still think they should have just called this the iPhone 12s. The top camera is a three times
dataset/train/44_67.wav|telephoto lens, which is .5 times more zoom than last year. Yeehaw. There is the 12 megapixel ultra
dataset/train/44_68.wav|wide camera in the middle. And a 12 megapixel normal camera at the bottom. It does have a lidar
dataset/train/44_69.wav|scanner which is pretty cool. One thing that’s not cool, however, is that Apple is still bragging
dataset/train/44_70.wav|that they have sapphire crystal covering on their camera lenses. They’ve never really talked about
dataset/train/44_71.wav|this in real life, nor does it benefit them in any way to keep mentioning it on their spec page. One,
dataset/train/44_72.wav|because it barely registers as sapphire. And two, it’s not pure as we’ve seen in my other video.
dataset/train/44_73.wav|And even more importantly, it has none of the protective properties that come with pure
dataset/train/44_74.wav|sapphire. I accidentally started this test at a level 9 thinking it was 6, so let’s just jump down
dataset/train/44_75.wav|to the wide angle. The regular wide angle camera lens clearly has scratches starting at level 6,
dataset/train/44_76.wav|7, and 8. While we know from other sapphire screened phones, like the Kyocera Duraforce Ultra,
dataset/train/44_77.wav|that real sapphire doesn’t start scratching until level 8.
dataset/train/44_78.wav|Apple needs to ditch their sapphire claims or find a real sapphire supplier.
dataset/train/44_79.wav|Another thing that Apple doesn’t mention very often, or probably should mention a little bit
dataset/train/44_80.wav|more is that every Apple store data center and operations facility are all carbon neutral. Apple
dataset/train/44_81.wav|has been using a small portion of their 200 billion cash reserve, about 3%, to invest in
dataset/train/44_82.wav|environmental projects around the world. Restoring the rain forest and building green energy plants
dataset/train/44_83.wav|to counteract their entire carbon footprint. This is way cool and I think every business should do
dataset/train/44_84.wav|this. I don’t want to sound indignant, but imagine what Apple could do with 4% or even 10%. I don’t
dataset/train/44_85.wav|know if Apple’s saving up to buy the moon or what since they are currently worth more than entire
dataset/train/44_86.wav|countries like Canada, Italy, or Russia. I’m just not really sure what they are waiting for. The
dataset/train/44_87.wav|nice thing about this 6.7 inch 120 hertz ceramic shield display is that for some reason it’s not
dataset/train/44_88.wav|burning under the heat from my lighter, which lets me talk for a really long time. Even though
dataset/train/44_89.wav|my phone was undamaged by flame, keep in mind that I buy my own devices. So my mom doesn’t care
dataset/train/44_90.wav|what I do with them. But if your mom just bought you a new iPhone and you take a lighter to it,
dataset/train/44_91.wav|you might not be around to watch my next video. So leave the professional burning stuff to me.
dataset/train/44_92.wav|The oleophobic coating is probably evaporated. I would test the fingerprint scanner if there
dataset/train/44_93.wav|was one, but there’s not so let’s move on to the bend test. Since the iPhone 6,
dataset/train/44_94.wav|Apple has really improved in the rigidity department. The apps are quivering a bit
dataset/train/44_95.wav|in anticipation. And if you listen closely,
dataset/train/44_96.wav|there are a few subtle creaks and groans as it gets bent, but no catastrophic damage. When bent
dataset/train/44_97.wav|from the front we have no additional sounds and the phone remains super solid on all 4 sides.
dataset/train/44_98.wav|Another solid device from Apple. We’ll have to see how much larger that battery is during
dataset/train/44_99.wav|the teardown. Hit that subscribe button so you don’t miss it. This iPhone 13 Pro Max
dataset/train/44_100.wav|survives my durability test. How often do you replace your own phone? Let me know down
dataset/train/44_101.wav|in the comments. If you need protection for your device or a charging brick from Anker,
dataset/train/44_102.wav|I’ll leave those links down in the description. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/44_103.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I’ll see you around.
dataset/train/45_1.wav|In front of us today we have the Galaxy Z Flip 3 – the younger and cheaper brother to the Galaxy
dataset/train/45_2.wav|Fold 3. With a much smaller hinge and a much longer design, the durability test should be
dataset/train/45_3.wav|interesting. Huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. Stamps.com is giving
dataset/train/45_4.wav|away some technology of their own – a free 5 pound digital scale similar to this one,

dataset/train/45_14.wav|it's a win-win for everyone. I'll leave a link down in the description Stamps.com/Jerryrig.
dataset/train/45_15.wav|Now it's time to see if our Z Flip 3 has any durabilitee. Let's get started.
dataset/train/45_16.wav|The Z Flip 3. Honestly, if I had to pick my favorite folding phone at the moment,
dataset/train/45_17.wav|it would probably be this guy. Having something that unfolds into a regular sized phone is more
dataset/train/45_18.wav|convenient than having a regular sized phone that folds into a tablet like the Fold 3 does.
dataset/train/45_19.wav|My personal two year old Note 10 Plus, though, is still working pretty great,
dataset/train/45_20.wav|so I'll probably keep it around for another year or two before I think about upgrading.
dataset/train/45_21.wav|This Flip 3 has the same warnings as the Fold 3. No fingernails,
dataset/train/45_22.wav|it's not dust resistant, and it also says not to remove the protective screen protector...you know,
dataset/train/45_23.wav|the same warnings as the previous generations. For me, sometimes the anticipation of having new tech
dataset/train/45_24.wav|is actually more fun than having the new tech. The novelty or funness seems to wear off rather
dataset/train/45_25.wav|quickly once I've achieved ownership. Is that just me though, or do you feel the same way?
dataset/train/45_26.wav|Let me know down in the comments. The Flip 3 does have a 10 megapixel internal selfie camera.
dataset/train/45_27.wav|This time not hidden by pixels. But the Flip does have a cool little trick that allows the outside
dataset/train/45_28.wav|notification screen to act like a viewfinder for the higher quality cameras. Kind of fun.
dataset/train/45_29.wav|Let's start out here. The Mohs scale of hardness is used to differentiate between different
dataset/train/45_30.wav|minerals. We use it here on my channel to differentiate between different screen materials.
dataset/train/45_31.wav|Plastic scratches at level 2 or 3, glass scratches at a 5 or 6, and sapphire would
dataset/train/45_32.wav|scratch at a level 8 or 9. The exterior display on the Flip 3 starts showing scratches at a level 6,
dataset/train/45_33.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7, meaning we're working with tempered glass.
dataset/train/45_34.wav|Gorilla Glass Victus to be exact. The interior flexible screen, however, is where we will
dataset/train/45_35.wav|most likely see some softer materials since glass doesn't tend to be real good. Samsung
dataset/train/45_36.wav|has to use something else. And as we can see, once again, we're getting marks at a level 2,
dataset/train/45_37.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 3. Super soft. But now that we know it's soft,
dataset/train/45_38.wav|we can take steps to avoid future gouges. So keep that in mind if you're a human with fingernails.
dataset/train/45_39.wav|There is a screen protector placed on top of this internal display. If it's anything like the Fold
dataset/train/45_40.wav|3, this one is probably safely removable. But then it does leave the permanent screen
dataset/train/45_41.wav|underneath even more vulnerable to scratches. So we'll do what Samsung says and leave it in place,
dataset/train/45_42.wav|at least until the teardown. This is the lavender colored Flip 3. Samsung says
dataset/train/45_43.wav|their armor aluminum is about 10% stronger than the aluminum they normally use on smartphones.
dataset/train/45_44.wav|But the colored anodizing still scratches. We'll come back to the
dataset/train/45_45.wav|recessed fingerprint scanning power button. The volume rocker is made from metal,
dataset/train/45_46.wav|along with the top of the phone. Running down the left side we have the metal SIM card tray,
dataset/train/45_47.wav|along with a large plastic plug for the internal 5G antenna. We'll have to double
dataset/train/45_48.wav|check on that during the teardown, but the plug itself seems to be very well secure.
dataset/train/45_49.wav|The SIM card tray does have a rubber ring around the opening and Samsung
dataset/train/45_50.wav|says this phone is water resistant up to 1.5 meters deep in water for 30 minutes.
dataset/train/45_51.wav|Pretty impressive considering all the moving parts and openings. The bottom has a USB-C port,
dataset/train/45_52.wav|loudspeaker, and microphone holes. The hinge is capable of stopping in multiple positions
dataset/train/45_53.wav|this year. Kind of a fun development. Then back here for the rear cameras we have a 12
dataset/train/45_54.wav|megapixel ultra wide camera on top. Along with a 12 megapixel wide angle camera right below that,
dataset/train/45_55.wav|both covered with glass. Interestingly, the flash is also covered by the rear glass panel. It'll be
dataset/train/45_56.wav|coll to see what that looks like from the inside. The purple lavender color is covering both halves
dataset/train/45_57.wav|of the phone. And between those two halves we have the hinge. Samsung has been fine tuning this
dataset/train/45_58.wav|thing for about 3 generations now, adding dust protection with internal bristles on version 2.
dataset/train/45_59.wav|And now multiposition in version 3. Still made from metal though.
dataset/train/45_60.wav|The inlay lettering on the spine is also done with shiny pieces of color matched plastic
dataset/train/45_61.wav|and can be removed, but probably won't be falling out on their own. I do like the versatility of
dataset/train/45_62.wav|the Flip where the notifications and information can still be accessed while the phone is closed,
dataset/train/45_63.wav|getting information quickly and easily is what technology is all about. It's a tool,
dataset/train/45_64.wav|and having some of that info displayed on the outside 1.9 inch screen eliminates the need to
dataset/train/45_65.wav|flip over the phone for every task. I'm kind of lazy like that. So it's a useful feature.
dataset/train/45_66.wav|The external AMOLED display lasted for about 205 seconds under the heat from my lighter,
dataset/train/45_67.wav|which coincidentally is about the same amount of time it takes to get vaccinated.
dataset/train/45_68.wav|Congrats to 70% of Americans who have at least one shot. Still quite a ways behind Portugal, Iceland,
dataset/train/45_69.wav|and Spain though who are all about 80%. Go team. Worldwide solutions to a worldwide problem.
dataset/train/45_70.wav|The inner screen actually fared quite a bit better than I anticipated under the heat from my
dataset/train/45_71.wav|flame...all 6.7 inches of it. We know the surface of the foldable AMOLED is made from plastic.
dataset/train/45_72.wav|And after about 30 seconds that surface is where we see the majority of the damage,
dataset/train/45_73.wav|not on the pixels. The fire has physically melted a portion of the plastic screen
dataset/train/45_74.wav|and there's a physical blemish where the fire used to be. Fire is actually scientifically used to
dataset/train/45_75.wav|differentiate between different types of plastic by the smoke, smell, color, and speed of burning,
dataset/train/45_76.wav|and whether the plastic drips or not. So if the burn test is your favorite part of durability,
dataset/train/45_77.wav|you'll be pleased to know that there's actually a whole career dedicated to plastic burning.
dataset/train/45_78.wav|We do need more brains figuring out how to safely get rid of it.
dataset/train/45_79.wav|The fingerprint scanner is once again located on the side of the Flip 3,
dataset/train/45_80.wav|just like it was on the Fold. And after setting my fingerprint, slicing up the surface of the
dataset/train/45_81.wav|power button a bit, everything appears to still be working. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/45_82.wav|Now personally I've become rather unaffected or unfazed when bending or breaking normal phones.
dataset/train/45_83.wav|You know, the block style rectangles. But these folding phones have a cool factor that make even
dataset/train/45_84.wav|my heart hurt a little when they are damaged. We know, of course, that it folds in half real good,
dataset/train/45_85.wav|even when folded aggressively. The black plastic bumper around the edge of the screen does a good
dataset/train/45_86.wav|job of absorbing any impact from this direction. However, bending from the opposite direction still
dataset/train/45_87.wav|does need to happen because that's just what we do. When physically bent backward the Galaxy Flip
dataset/train/45_88.wav|3 takes the form of a bridge, going much further out of alignment than I would have expected.
dataset/train/45_89.wav|Speaking of bridges though, going from one patch of earth to another, I bet you thought I forgot
dataset/train/45_90.wav|about the dust test...which I did. But then I remembered. The phone though is still working
dataset/train/45_91.wav|so it's fine. Someone said in my Fold video that I should be a little more aggressive with
dataset/train/45_92.wav|the dust from now on and I agree. We'll apply the dirt from the front, as well as the back,
dataset/train/45_93.wav|and sprinkle a little more on the hinge for good measure. And even after being bent once
dataset/train/45_94.wav|and dusted all over, the Flip 3 still has a completely silent hinge mechanism.
dataset/train/45_95.wav|A huge improvement over the first generation of folding hinges.
dataset/train/45_96.wav|Those collected dust like it was their job.
dataset/train/45_97.wav|Back to the bend test. Bending again from the back with the same amount of force that we used
dataset/train/45_98.wav|to snap the ROG 5 and the Legion Duel 2, this Flip 3 is still very much intact. It remains
dataset/train/45_99.wav|physically deformed at those small antenna lines and not quite straight anymore when unfolded,
dataset/train/45_100.wav|but the Flip 3 is still very much alive and very surprisingly survives my durability test.
dataset/train/45_101.wav|Samsung has once again managed to take one of the most creative form factors we've ever seen
dataset/train/45_102.wav|and also make it durable. Nice work, Samsung.
dataset/train/45_103.wav|Which style of folding phone do you prefer? The Flip or the Fold? Let me know down in
dataset/train/45_104.wav|the comments. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me
dataset/train/45_105.wav|on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/46_1.wav|Here we are with a fully intact Galaxy Fold 3. Having survived my rather strenuous durability
dataset/train/46_2.wav|test, it's time to take this Fold 3 apart and see how it works from the inside. We'll see how
dataset/train/46_3.wav|Samsung has made this thing ipx8 water resistant. Did they use a hydrophobic circuit board coating
dataset/train/46_4.wav|or just normal ingress point sealings? There's only one way to find out. I've had a few people
dataset/train/46_5.wav|ask about the screen protector on the inner screen of the Galaxy Fold 3. If you remember,
dataset/train/46_6.wav|Samsung very specifically says not to remove the protective film on the large main screen, which
dataset/train/46_7.wav|to me makes it seem like it's not an optional or temporary layer of protection - it's mandatory.
dataset/train/46_8.wav|However, for the sake of science I think that we can indeed see what happens when we remove
dataset/train/46_9.wav|that layer. I'll take off my Teardown Skin first since once we're done here I'm pretty
dataset/train/46_10.wav|sure this Fold 3 will never look the same. So if you want a transparent Teardown Skin for
dataset/train/46_11.wav|your own phone or tablet, I'll leave a link down in the description. Let's get started.
dataset/train/46_12.wav|Let's start with the main screen. Obviously this would be the wrong place to start if we wanted the
dataset/train/46_13.wav|phone to survive, but since your morbid curiosity led you to click this video and subscribe to my
dataset/train/46_14.wav|channel, let's just see how far we get from this side, you know, back to that science thing. With
dataset/train/46_15.wav|previous versions of the Fold, the top surface was a rubbery layer that was difficult to remove. This
dataset/train/46_16.wav|time around it's a thin piece of plastic that is actually rather easy to take off.
dataset/train/46_17.wav|I can tell it's high quality and supposed to be there and
dataset/train/46_18.wav|probably won't fall off on its own, but at the same time it does come off pretty easy.
dataset/train/46_19.wav|It also uses actual adhesive and not just static to hold itself in place,
dataset/train/46_20.wav|like we saw in the exterior temporary plastics. By removing this top layer we have also removed
dataset/train/46_21.wav|the damage inflicted by my level 2 and 3 Mohs hardness picks during that durability test.
dataset/train/46_22.wav|The surface of the center folding screen is now as pristine as the day it was made.
dataset/train/46_23.wav|But once again, my level 2 pick and fingernail can still make short work of the surface.
dataset/train/46_24.wav|It's good to know though that there is a sacrificial layer of plastic on top of the rest of
dataset/train/46_25.wav|the plastic. Just like with the fold 1 and 2 there is still a black plastic bumper around the edge of
dataset/train/46_26.wav|the flexible display. Where the bumpers meet in the middle there's also a thin strip of rubber
dataset/train/46_27.wav|which I imagine is one of the many components working to keep dust and rocks out of the
dataset/train/46_28.wav|complex gear mechanisms that make up the hinge. It might be my imagination but it
dataset/train/46_29.wav|does seem like this bumper is more permanent than last year. It is very difficult to remove.
dataset/train/46_30.wav|Time to get serious.
dataset/train/46_31.wav|I'll use some heat on the bumper to see if we can soften whatever glue is holding it in place,
dataset/train/46_32.wav|but even then I gotta peel it like a potato instead of it coming up on its own.
dataset/train/46_33.wav|Finally with the bumper shaved we can try peeling up the screen. I'll attempt to remove it in one
dataset/train/46_34.wav|piece by first slipping my pry tool underneath the metal back supporting layer. The main problem we
dataset/train/46_35.wav|are going to encounter though is that I'm not sure where the ribbon connectors are located underneath
dataset/train/46_36.wav|this layer, so if I accidentally slice into one of those while lifting up the flexible screen,
dataset/train/46_37.wav|it's curtains for this display. The problem with the edge protector being off now is
dataset/train/46_38.wav|that if anything happens to accidentally touch that edge, the screen gets destroyed.
dataset/train/46_39.wav|Smart move of Samsung to make that bumper permanent. Something
dataset/train/46_40.wav|tells me that we aren't going to be successful in removing the screen in one piece anymore,
dataset/train/46_41.wav|but at least we can still check it for the ultra thin glass.
dataset/train/46_42.wav|Samsung didn't really talk much about their thin layer of glass underneath the plastic this year,
dataset/train/46_43.wav|and they don't even mention it on the Fold 3 spec page on their website either. Probably
dataset/train/46_44.wav|because there just isn't much to talk about, but it is still definitely a part of the display.
dataset/train/46_45.wav|The crispy super thin layer of glass is right underneath the main rubbery plastic layer.
dataset/train/46_46.wav|We'll have to check out the other layers on the
dataset/train/46_47.wav|screen once we get this thing opened up and the waterproofing analyzed.
dataset/train/46_48.wav|The inner display be tripping, but the outer display is still working like normal.
dataset/train/46_49.wav|I'll shut the phone down and we can add some heat to remove the back glass and the front screen.
dataset/train/46_50.wav|Crazy that 75 of the surface of this phone is covered with pixels. I can take off the rear
dataset/train/46_51.wav|glass panel first. Some heat in my trusty razor knife can slice through that softened adhesive
dataset/train/46_52.wav|and my suction cup can lift it up and off. This is harder than it looks, and I'm taking special
dataset/train/46_53.wav|care with my knife so that the angle doesn't cut the battery or ribbons laying around the edges.
dataset/train/46_54.wav|The screen is a little more difficult since the bezels are so tiny. One touch with my razor
dataset/train/46_55.wav|blade to those pixels and this front screen will end up just like that center screen.
dataset/train/46_56.wav|The long edge is easiest to get underneath and I can just slice around under the glass
dataset/train/46_57.wav|to get rid of that adhesive. Once again this is harder than it looks.
dataset/train/46_58.wav|Finally, with all the adhesive detached, the screen is loose and still amazingly turns on.
dataset/train/46_59.wav|I can unplug the singular ribbon cable connecting it to the motherboard and set it off to the side
dataset/train/46_60.wav|giving us access to both halves of the Fold 3 and the 29 screws holding everything together.
dataset/train/46_61.wav|In order for us to see if the motherboard is hydrophobic, we need to remove the black plastics.
dataset/train/46_62.wav|The top portion contains the upper stereo loudspeaker with its foam balls.
dataset/train/46_63.wav|And on the left side we can remove the plastics containing the wireless charger,
dataset/train/46_64.wav|which I mean, for me personally would look way cooler if they left the copper coils visible.
dataset/train/46_65.wav|I'll unplug the two batteries just like little Legos.
dataset/train/46_66.wav|And of course, remove the SIM card tray so we can get access to the SIM card slot
dataset/train/46_67.wav|which is on its own cute little motherboard. The bottom loudspeaker comes out next. This phone is
dataset/train/46_68.wav|super modular which is kind of nice. The bottom loudspeaker has two sets of balls that's unique.
dataset/train/46_69.wav|I'll pop off the two ribbons that connect the halves of the phone together along with one of
dataset/train/46_70.wav|the screen ribbons, and then we get our first look at the smaller of the two motherboards. At first
dataset/train/46_71.wav|glance this thing does not look hydrophobic. The hydrophobic boards usually have a shiny coating
dataset/train/46_72.wav|on top that helps protect the components, but we'll analyze it a little closer in a second.
dataset/train/46_73.wav|The front-facing selfie camera is 10 megapixels and does not have any optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/46_74.wav|I'll remove the charging port plastics, then the two ribbons that join up the halves again along
dataset/train/46_75.wav|with three screws that hold down the charging port board. For those of you keeping track at home
dataset/train/46_76.wav|we've now removed 32 screws. The charging port does have a red rubber ring around the opening
dataset/train/46_77.wav|to help keep water out. We'll look for more ingress protections in a second. The motherboard
dataset/train/46_78.wav|has a few more ribbon cables along with one of our 5G antennas. 5G is what the government uses
dataset/train/46_79.wav|to read your mind... Just kidding, all they need is Facebook. The other 5G antenna is over here,
dataset/train/46_80.wav|and this one emits cerebral wave inhibitors that slow your brain and
dataset/train/46_81.wav|keep you misinformed. I'm just kidding, that's also Facebook.
dataset/train/46_82.wav|There are three more screws on the motherboard bringing our total number of screws to 35.
dataset/train/46_83.wav|Does it feel like Dora the Explorer when I count screws like that?
dataset/train/46_84.wav|Or more like some adult version of Sesame Street? With the motherboard up and out of the phone, we
dataset/train/46_85.wav|get a close-up look at the cameras. The top camera being a 12 megapixel ultra wide angle with no OIS.
dataset/train/46_86.wav|The main center camera does have OIS along with the telephoto camera right below it.
dataset/train/46_87.wav|It also has the optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/46_88.wav|Now for that hydrophobic coating. This is just a rumor of course, Samsung hasn't specifically said
dataset/train/46_89.wav|how they've managed to achieve that ipx8 rating. The ipx8 means that it's water resistant up to
dataset/train/46_90.wav|one and a half meters deep for 30 minutes. The x part of the rating means there's no
dataset/train/46_91.wav|protection against dust. With my handy dandy water dripper...what is this Blue's Clues?...
dataset/train/46_92.wav|We can drip some tap water onto the board to see if the droplet will cling to the surface.
dataset/train/46_93.wav|If the water clings then it's not hydrophobic. And it looks like the water is indeed sticking
dataset/train/46_94.wav|to the surface of the board which means it's not coated and not protected against water if water
dataset/train/46_95.wav|gets inside, just like most other smartphones out there. The water protection for the Fold 3
dataset/train/46_96.wav|are probably just built into the frame. The only hydrophobic board I've come across in my travels
dataset/train/46_97.wav|was a waterproof pair of headphones from a company that's long since ceased to exist,
dataset/train/46_98.wav|but you can see how the water just beads up and rolls off the board without sticking to anything.
dataset/train/46_99.wav|So hydrophobic circuit boards do exist, just not on this Galaxy Fold 3. The water continues
dataset/train/46_100.wav|to grip the board even when upside down. Of course it might be coated in something
dataset/train/46_101.wav|else that's not hydrophobic but still corrosion resistant, but Samsung has not been specific.
dataset/train/46_102.wav|So how does Samsung keep all the water on the outside? In order to find that out we need to
dataset/train/46_103.wav|remove the batteries. I've switched the clear liquid inside my handy dandy dripper to isopropyl
dataset/train/46_104.wav|alcohol so I can let it seep in behind the batteries to start dissolving the adhesive holding
dataset/train/46_105.wav|the batteries to the phone. While the alcohol is doing its thing I can gently lift up the battery
dataset/train/46_106.wav|with two pry tools. This battery is a 2,280 milliamp hour capacity, while the other battery
dataset/train/46_107.wav|is a 2,120 milliamp hour, which if you're keeping track at home, is a total of 4,400 milliamp hours.
dataset/train/46_108.wav|Now as far as waterproofing goes, obviously we had that red rubber ring around the charging port that
dataset/train/46_109.wav|at least covers one hole. Then we have the power button and fingerprint reader over here,
dataset/train/46_110.wav|which has a rather sophisticated rubber gasket filling up the entry point behind that button.
dataset/train/46_111.wav|Then there are two microphone holes up here at the top. Each of them have a water screen laid
dataset/train/46_112.wav|off to the side of the shaft that helps keep water out. The top loudspeaker grill has more rubber
dataset/train/46_113.wav|and the same waterproofing mesh, while the pin for the SIM card tray has its own red rubber gasket.
dataset/train/46_114.wav|And the SIM card itself obviously has the rubber ring around the opening,
dataset/train/46_115.wav|and the bottom of the phone has another large screen and even more rubber for
dataset/train/46_116.wav|the lower loudspeaker. But the coolest innovation by far is how Samsung managed
dataset/train/46_117.wav|to waterproof the inner ribbons that connect each half of the phone through the hinge.
dataset/train/46_118.wav|It looks like each of those ribbons have a red rubber gasket lined with the world's smallest
dataset/train/46_119.wav|bead of clear silicone - the same clear stuff you would caulk around your shower or windows
dataset/train/46_120.wav|to keep water out. They've added it all around the edges of each of these four ribbon entry points.
dataset/train/46_121.wav|Super cool. While the boards themselves might not be hydrophobic, the entry points for either half
dataset/train/46_122.wav|of this phone will indeed keep the phone water resistant. Obviously I wouldn't go dunking my
dataset/train/46_123.wav|$1800 phone in water for kicks and giggles since water damage is still not covered under warranty,
dataset/train/46_124.wav|but it is still nice knowing that the ipx8 protection is there for the accidental immersions.
dataset/train/46_125.wav|Let's take a closer look at the flexible display and the hinge of the Fold 3. The display is made
dataset/train/46_126.wav|up of a bunch of different layers. We've already seen the top plastic and the second layer of
dataset/train/46_127.wav|plastic, and the third layer of ultra thin glass which is followed by the pixels themselves.
dataset/train/46_128.wav|Behind everything there are large metal plates
dataset/train/46_129.wav|with a super cool rubber backing and metal slat joint for the hinge,
dataset/train/46_130.wav|which I assume supports the curve of the screen while keeping dust from entering the hinge.
dataset/train/46_131.wav|The hinge, as you'll see in a second, is rather exposed once the screen is removed.
dataset/train/46_132.wav|Just above the metal plate layer is the digitizer layer, which can detect the copper coils from
dataset/train/46_133.wav|inside the Fold's S-pin and pinpoint the stylus when it's not even touching the surface of the
dataset/train/46_134.wav|screen. I'm going to be honest this phone, the Fold 3, is 100 percent the most technologically
dataset/train/46_135.wav|advanced smartphone on the planet, by far, pushing the absolute limits of the smartphone form factor
dataset/train/46_136.wav|while doing it in a way that is still surprisingly durable. Like we still
dataset/train/46_137.wav|have the underscreen camera to look at, and yeah, it might all cost as much as two phones,
dataset/train/46_138.wav|but it does have two halves and by that math, the price is relatively justified.
dataset/train/46_139.wav|Finally let's take apart the hinge. As you can see with the screen gone, the hinge is
dataset/train/46_140.wav|very much exposed. That rubber strip at each end and the rubber seam is pretty important.
dataset/train/46_141.wav|I'll peel off the black tape over the screw locations.
dataset/train/46_142.wav|25 more screws brings our total to...don't do it... 60.
dataset/train/46_143.wav|And we can finally get a close-up look at how the hinge works. Not a whole lot
dataset/train/46_144.wav|has changed through the generations. We still have these super strong springs on the side,
dataset/train/46_145.wav|and the gears in the center that keep things lined up when it's moving between being opened and
dataset/train/46_146.wav|closed. The left and right sides along with the top and bottom are pretty identical to each other.
dataset/train/46_147.wav|You might have noticed as well the five screws in the center. These are only there to hold the
dataset/train/46_148.wav|metal back spine to the hinges... that brings us to 65. And of course, Samsung still has their
dataset/train/46_149.wav|stiff bristles along the edge of the spine to also help keep the dust and dirt out from the complex
dataset/train/46_150.wav|inner workings of that hinge, since any dust or dirt getting inside would be pretty catastrophic.
dataset/train/46_151.wav|It's pretty well protected and as we saw from the durability test where I covered it in dust
dataset/train/46_152.wav|and dirt, that protection translates well into real life scenarios. This year we've seen gaming
dataset/train/46_153.wav|phones snap in half left and right, while Samsung is over here with a near invincible masterpiece of
dataset/train/46_154.wav|technological design. Yeah, the center screen is still plastic and that won't change anytime soon,
dataset/train/46_155.wav|but the phone as a whole is stronger than Oscar the Grouch's trash can.
dataset/train/46_156.wav|This video is sponsored by the color blue the number four,
dataset/train/46_157.wav|and definitely go buy my Teardown Skin for your phone with the link in the description
dataset/train/46_158.wav|because there's no way this $1800 device is going back together in one piece.
dataset/train/46_159.wav|Let me know what surprised you most about this phone down in the comments. And come hang out
dataset/train/46_160.wav|with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/47_1.wav|The Samsung Galaxy Fold 3. Here we are yet again with Samsung's Flagship folding phone. Samsung
dataset/train/47_2.wav|says they've upgraded several things, like the internal screen durability, and something called
dataset/train/47_3.wav|armor aluminum. But even without opening the box, the biggest improvement I see is the
dataset/train/47_4.wav|packaging. Huge props to Samsung for ditching the plastic. Plastic packaging is usually not
dataset/train/47_5.wav|recyclable and takes about 450 years to decompose in a landfill which is crazy. Your plastic bubble
dataset/train/47_6.wav|wrap or packing material will be around for the next 25 generations. Your 20th great grandchild
dataset/train/47_7.wav|will still be able to find everything plastic that you've thrown away still chilling in the dirt,
dataset/train/47_8.wav|which is pretty gross. Sustainably sourced paper, on the other hand, can be recycled 6
dataset/train/47_9.wav|times and decomposes in just 2-6 weeks. And more trees get planted to make it. Huge win
dataset/train/47_10.wav|for everyone including the planet. Thumbs up to Samsung for making the switch. Let's get started.
dataset/train/47_11.wav|This new Galaxy Fold 3 starts at $1800. Pretty expensive for a phone,
dataset/train/47_12.wav|but this phone is rather unique. Inside the box we get a USB-C cable but no charging brick.
dataset/train/47_13.wav|But that's fine, most people already have one. And Anker makes faster chargers and
dataset/train/47_14.wav|longer cables anyway. I'll leave a link for my channel's sponsor Anker down in the description.
dataset/train/47_15.wav|There are magnets inside the Galaxy Fold 3. It's kind of towing my lighter across the table.
dataset/train/47_16.wav|But you didn't come here for the magnetic attraction, you're here for the Mohs action.
dataset/train/47_17.wav|And it looks like again this year we might see some carnage. The warning list turning
dataset/train/47_18.wav|on the phone is still a mile long, including no touching the display with a fingernail,
dataset/train/47_19.wav|only using the specially built S Pen Fold edition. And, you know, dust might cause damage. All while
dataset/train/47_20.wav|not removing any screen protectors. Samsung makes it seem like this Fold 3 needs to be
dataset/train/47_21.wav|handled with white gloves and a clean room, but we'll see how true all that is. The Fold 3 is
dataset/train/47_22.wav|very similar in appearance to the Fold 2 and Fold 1, with a small gap between the folded screens,
dataset/train/47_23.wav|and a wedge shape when closed. I imagine the gap helps keep the screen from creasing too tight
dataset/train/47_24.wav|and to help keep the two screens from rubbing up against each other when it's closed.
dataset/train/47_25.wav|Let's start the scratch test. The Fold 3 has two screens. The exterior front facing screen
dataset/train/47_26.wav|does come with a removable screen protector. At least I hope this one comes off.
dataset/train/47_27.wav|The Mohs scale of hardness helps us differentiate between different materials,
dataset/train/47_28.wav|like plastic which scratches at a level 2 or 3. Glass, which scratches at 5 or 6.
dataset/train/47_29.wav|And sapphire which scratches at a level 8 or 9. Samsung says they're using Gorilla Glass
dataset/train/47_30.wav|Victus on both the front and back of the Fold 3,
dataset/train/47_31.wav|and that matches up perfectly with our scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/47_32.wav|The same slab of Victus glass is up protecting the 10 megapixel camera. It's as scratch resistant as
dataset/train/47_33.wav|the rest of the front screen. Opening the phone while the camera is on transitions us to the
dataset/train/47_34.wav|much larger screen in the center, along with the hidden underscreen camera up on the top right.
dataset/train/47_35.wav|We've seen underscreen cameras before with the Axon 20 and the Axon 30. And it looks
dataset/train/47_36.wav|like Samsung also has that super low resolution pixel grouping above the camera that we saw on
dataset/train/47_37.wav|the First Generation Axon 20. They're about a year behind. The pixels turn off when the front facing
dataset/train/47_38.wav|camera's activated. Then the pixels turn back on when the front camera is off. And honestly it's
dataset/train/47_39.wav|not that bad. The halo around my studio light is minimal. The camera itself was only 4 megapixels,
dataset/train/47_40.wav|but since there are literally 4 other nicer cameras to choose from on this same device,
dataset/train/47_41.wav|it's really not that big of a deal. And it's pretty cool that Samsung's trying something new.
dataset/train/47_42.wav|I'm all for it. Samsung has said that with this Fold 3, their middle screen is 80% more
dataset/train/47_43.wav|durable than last year's, which would be pretty impressive. The Mohs scale of hardness isn't
dataset/train/47_44.wav|the best scale to use on different levels of plastic. No matter what plastic it is it will
dataset/train/47_45.wav|all fall between level 2 or 3. We would need something like a shore durometer to fine tune
dataset/train/47_46.wav|that scale and see if the hardness levels improve between generations. Because as of right now,
dataset/train/47_47.wav|we're still getting scratches at a level 2, with deeper grooves at a level 3. And
dataset/train/47_48.wav|once again my fingernail is still able to leave very noticeable marks on the surface.
dataset/train/47_49.wav|The display underneath the plastic might be 80% more durable,
dataset/train/47_50.wav|but it's still very soft on the surface which is just something to keep in mind. The more we know
dataset/train/47_51.wav|what to avoid, the longer the phone will last and stay in good shape during it's lifespan.
dataset/train/47_52.wav|The front camera is also tucked underneath this soft plastic layer and could get scratched - all
dataset/train/47_53.wav|4 megapixels of it. Samsung has created a special fold edition S Pen stylus for this Fold 3,
dataset/train/47_54.wav|with a special spring loaded tip to help relieve the pressure on the surface of the screen.
dataset/train/47_55.wav|It's a pretty strong spring inside. Pressing the tip of the stylus onto the screen,
dataset/train/47_56.wav|it does leave a slight indentation onto the plastic. I'm only pressing about 50%
dataset/train/47_57.wav|of the spring's capacity, it's not fully locked out. And even at 50%,
dataset/train/47_58.wav|this is probably pressing harder than most people would ever be drawing with the S Pen.
dataset/train/47_59.wav|Wiping off the display it's pretty impossible to re-find the marks I was making.
dataset/train/47_60.wav|So I would say that the S Pen is indeed safe to use on the screen. S Pen yes, fingernails no.
dataset/train/47_61.wav|Inside of the S Pen are some interesting things.
dataset/train/47_62.wav|We have the lower half of the Pen with it's removable and replaceable tip,
dataset/train/47_63.wav|along with a coil of copper wires that let the digitizers under the folding display
dataset/train/47_64.wav|sense where the S Pen is at, even while it's hovering above the surface of the screen.
dataset/train/47_65.wav|The top half of the Pen is where we find the spring, along with a pretty beady magnet.
dataset/train/47_66.wav|Another thing Samsung talked about in their launch event was the armor aluminum. And I'm
dataset/train/47_67.wav|not sure what aspects of the aluminum are armored though since it appears to scratch about the same
dataset/train/47_68.wav|as most other aluminum phones out there. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/47_69.wav|And the volume rocker is made from metal. The oval of plastic up here
dataset/train/47_70.wav|is probably for the 5G antenna, but we'll have to check that during the teardown.
dataset/train/47_71.wav|Folding the phone shut we can scratch both top halves of the phone at the same time. We have
dataset/train/47_72.wav|a few microphones and a loudspeaker up here. We get some more aluminum on the hinge of the phone,
dataset/train/47_73.wav|along with some inlaid Samsung lettering – the same as last year.
dataset/train/47_74.wav|You can be loud if you really want to but it probably won't ever fall out on its own.
dataset/train/47_75.wav|Down at the bottom of the phone we get our USB-C port and the second stereo loudspeaker.
dataset/train/47_76.wav|And over here on the last of the 6 sides we haven't tested yet,
dataset/train/47_77.wav|we have the SIM card tray which has room for one SIM card, and no expandable memory.
dataset/train/47_78.wav|All of these things we've kind of come to expect from the Galaxy Fold series of phones. One thing
dataset/train/47_79.wav|I did not see coming this year though was water resistance. This guy is ipx8. The x means it's not
dataset/train/47_80.wav|dust proof which is why I currently have a lot of dust in my hand. You might be asking, “Hey Jerry,
dataset/train/47_81.wav|how can a phone be water resistant but not dust resistant?” Well rumor is that Samsung has coated
dataset/train/47_82.wav|the internal circuits with an oleophobic coating. The coating can repel water without having to be
dataset/train/47_83.wav|watertight. Pretty cool technology since it would probably be pretty difficult to plug up all the
dataset/train/47_84.wav|gaps and holes on a folding phone which has all those gears inside the spine. We'll have to check
dataset/train/47_85.wav|out the oleophobic coating during the teardown. With rocks, dirt, and dust spilling out of both
dataset/train/47_86.wav|ends, I think it's pretty safe to say that this is reasonably the most dirt the folding phone could
dataset/train/47_87.wav|ever anticipate in real life. We'll open and close it a few more times all for good measure.
dataset/train/47_88.wav|Surprisingly though the hinge is still as silent as the day it was made. No rocks, dust,
dataset/train/47_89.wav|or dirt is captured inside. Not sure if Samsung is still doing that internal bristle thing or not,
dataset/train/47_90.wav|it's another thing we'll have to check during the tear down. But so far the dust resistance
dataset/train/47_91.wav|is pretty impressive. I wouldn't take it to the beach or job site of course,
dataset/train/47_92.wav|but it's nice to know that it's not going to fall apart with the first speck of dust it encounters.
dataset/train/47_93.wav|The back glass is textured Gorilla Glass Victus. And for the rear camera units we
dataset/train/47_94.wav|have a 12 megapixel telephoto, 12 megapixel main sensor, and 12 megapixel ultrawide.
dataset/train/47_95.wav|Easy to remember when they're all the same and all protected by glass.
dataset/train/47_96.wav|Making our way around to the front screen, we see it's a 6.2 inch dynamic AMOLED 2X,
dataset/train/47_97.wav|with a 120 hertz refresh rate. After about 14 seconds the screen does go black and the pixels
dataset/train/47_98.wav|kind of glow a dark red. Interesting. Let's see if the same thing happens on the middle screen.
dataset/train/47_99.wav|The middle screen is the same dynamic AMOLED, but includes some folding action. This guy is a square
dataset/train/47_100.wav|7.6 inches and has the same 120 hertz refresh rate. Oddly enough though, it lasts about twice
dataset/train/47_101.wav|as long on the burn test, with even less damage. The pixels only stayed a burned white color like
dataset/train/47_102.wav|we normally see on AMOLED displays. And even the plastic surface didn't suffer much damage, even
dataset/train/47_103.wav|after 30 seconds of fire. Not, you know, super relevant to everyday use, but still interesting.
dataset/train/47_104.wav|The fingerprint scanner is over here on the side of the phone. It's a capacitive
dataset/train/47_105.wav|sensor built right into the power button, which is where, personally,
dataset/train/47_106.wav|I think they should all be. Not a huge fan of the underscreen scanners myself.
dataset/train/47_107.wav|And after setting my thumbprint, and adding some hard core scratches to the side of the scanner,
dataset/train/47_108.wav|we can test it with everything appearing to work just like normal. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/47_109.wav|Finally, the bend test. The first Galaxy Fold did not survive my durability test,
dataset/train/47_110.wav|but not because it physically snapped in half. The screen got poked, then it died.
dataset/train/47_111.wav|The second Galaxy Fold did survive all this abuse, and now it's time for the Galaxy Fold 3.
dataset/train/47_112.wav|It still has a very quiet hinge. And when folded shut there is no budge from the front or back.
dataset/train/47_113.wav|No surprise. We would expect that sturdiness from a folded phone and massive spine.
dataset/train/47_114.wav|But what about when the phone is opened and folded backwards? Even though this Fold 3 is
dataset/train/47_115.wav|thinner than last year's Fold 2, we still have no catastrophic damage while bending from the back.
dataset/train/47_116.wav|There was a slight complaint, which made me nervous, but still no damage to the screen,
dataset/train/47_117.wav|even after attempting it again. The Galaxy Fold 3, surprisingly, survives my durability test.
dataset/train/47_118.wav|The soft inner display may not be the 80% harder surface that we were looking for,
dataset/train/47_119.wav|but the phone as a whole is for sure 80% stronger than it appears on paper.
dataset/train/47_120.wav|Nice work, Samsung. It would be interesting to get inside and see that oleophobic motherboard
dataset/train/47_121.wav|during the teardown. Speaking of which, if you want a sneak peek, there's always my Teardown
dataset/train/47_122.wav|Skin from dbrand showing off the inside of the phone from the outside without ever
dataset/train/47_123.wav|needing to take it apart. Doesn't get much cooler than that. I'll leave a link down in
dataset/train/47_124.wav|the description so you can grab a Skin for your own phone. And let me know down in the comments,
dataset/train/47_125.wav|at what price point, if any, would you buy a folding phone? I'm curious.
dataset/train/47_126.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/47_127.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/48_1.wav|Today we're going to be getting an underside look at the underscreen camera on the Axon
dataset/train/48_2.wav|30. And it'll be interesting to compare it side by side with the Samsung Fold 3, which
dataset/train/48_3.wav|also has an underscreen camera. We have to wait till I get my hands on that one. But
dataset/train/48_4.wav|we should still see some pretty cool hardware when this is opened up. And speaking of cool
dataset/train/48_5.wav|hardware, huge thanks to Mech Arena for sponsoring this video. Mech Arena is a brand new tactile
dataset/train/48_6.wav|team based mobile game that allows you to build and fight customizable Mechs, with upgradeable
dataset/train/48_7.wav|weapons. It's totally free to play. There are capture the base style rounds, or last
dataset/train/48_8.wav|man standing rounds. You can play by yourself, or with friends. There are dozens of Mechs
dataset/train/48_9.wav|and plenty of weapons to build up and collect. Plus, it's one of those games that you can
dataset/train/48_10.wav|just pick up and play for a couple minutes, or sit for hours if you really want to upgrade
dataset/train/48_11.wav|your tech. With the recent global launch, there are plenty of events and giveaways happening
dataset/train/48_12.wav|this week in the game. It's totally free on Android and iPhones, but if you own a Blackberry
dataset/train/48_13.wav|or Windows Phone you're kind of on your own. And if you use the link down in the description,
dataset/train/48_14.wav|you get an additional Steel Reaper Skin, as well as 500 A-coins, and 70,000 credits, so
dataset/train/48_15.wav|you can start customizing your own Mechs. My username in the game is JerryRig, so if
dataset/train/48_16.wav|you see me running around play nice and keep in mind that I was the one that left the link
dataset/train/48_17.wav|in the description for your free upgrades and coin. Now it's time to check out some
dataset/train/48_18.wav|real world hardware that can see through your screen. Let's get started.
dataset/train/48_19.wav|Underscreen cameras are kind of fascinating, like the high tech version of a 2-way mirror
dataset/train/48_20.wav|which means they are equally creepy. I'm curious though what would happen if we took the underscreen
dataset/train/48_21.wav|camera and brought it out from underneath the screen. Would it still work? Right now
dataset/train/48_22.wav|it's peering through 7 layers of transparent screen material. I want to see the camera
dataset/train/48_23.wav|quality when it's not buried. Maybe some of these halos would go away. Hopefully it'll
dataset/train/48_24.wav|all still work when the phone is taken apart.
dataset/train/48_25.wav|Heat is, once again, our friend, as well as a plastic back. Plastic is a lot more forgiving
dataset/train/48_26.wav|than a glass back panel, cuz as we know, glass is glass and glass breaks – plastic, not
dataset/train/48_27.wav|so much. With a few slices and dices from my razor blade, the plastic is cut loose from
dataset/train/48_28.wav|the softened adhesive and we're clear to start removing the screws holding down that plastic
dataset/train/48_29.wav|to the frame. There are 18 screws total and it looks like the battery is once again warning
dataset/train/48_30.wav|us not to dissemble. Maybe we should listen this time. Just kidding. With the screws removed
dataset/train/48_31.wav|we can start peeling off the back plastics. The seam runs along the side of the frame.
dataset/train/48_32.wav|I'll remove that SIM card tray and of course, there's one extra screw next to the orange
dataset/train/48_33.wav|ribbon that I missed. I'll pop that out and remove the NFC pad. I've actually never used
dataset/train/48_34.wav|NFC before and it looks like this phone never will either.
dataset/train/48_35.wav|For some reason the back plastics are still very difficult to remove and that might be
dataset/train/48_36.wav|because one, there's a sneaky little screw hidden under the metal and glass camera lens.
dataset/train/48_37.wav|And there's another screw right above that. I think I'm so used to working with massive
dataset/train/48_38.wav|Humvee parts that I forgot how tiny these little guys are. Finally though, the back
dataset/train/48_39.wav|plastics are off and the phone looks super clean inside. Dark circuit boards give it
dataset/train/48_40.wav|that matte black everything vibe. We want to leave everything plugged in and connected
dataset/train/48_41.wav|so we can run that camera once we pull it out from underneath the screen. I unscrewed
dataset/train/48_42.wav|the two silver screws holding down the motherboard before I realized that I could just peel back
dataset/train/48_43.wav|the front facing camera like a high tech banana and run the unit just like that.
dataset/train/48_44.wav|The screen of the Axon 30 is actually not totally clear. It is see-through for sure,
dataset/train/48_45.wav|but the 400 pixels per inch in front of the camera unit provides a murky greenish pond
dataset/train/48_46.wav|water aesthetic for the camera to be looking through. It'll be interesting to see how it
dataset/train/48_47.wav|compensates. I'll turn the phone on and then we can get our first look at the underscreen
dataset/train/48_48.wav|camera out from underneath the screen. And it looks surprisingly normal. Hardly any visible
dataset/train/48_49.wav|color correction. It looks like the front facing camera from any other $500 smartphone.
dataset/train/48_50.wav|And only when I put it back under the screen do those halos around the light show back
dataset/train/48_51.wav|up. Very interesting. Give me a thumbs up if you want to see me try this on the Fold
dataset/train/48_52.wav|3. With how much I enjoy seeing things work from the inside, it's probably good I didn't
dataset/train/48_53.wav|go into the medical industry. Props to those guys for everything they do though...especially
dataset/train/48_54.wav|lately.
dataset/train/48_55.wav|Let's go a bit deeper and see what cracks during the durability test. With the Axon
dataset/train/48_56.wav|30 turned off again, I'll unplug the two battery ribbons just like little Legos, along with
dataset/train/48_57.wav|the other ribbons running along that bottom side of the motherboard. The front facing
dataset/train/48_58.wav|camera is also connected with another Lego-style connector. It's a cute little guy. With all
dataset/train/48_59.wav|the ribbons and wires disconnected, the motherboard can pull free, revealing a large copper vapor
dataset/train/48_60.wav|chamber, as well as some blue thermal paste. The paste helps transfer heat from the processor
dataset/train/48_61.wav|to that vapor chamber and then gets rid of it.
dataset/train/48_62.wav|The two little cameras, the 5 megapixel macro camera and two megapixel depth camera do not
dataset/train/48_63.wav|have OIS. The large rear facing 64 megapixel camera and the 8 megapixel ultra wide also
dataset/train/48_64.wav|do not have any optical image stabilization. Coming down to the bottom of the phone, we
dataset/train/48_65.wav|find our other underscreen camera for the fingerprint reader. I've found that the scanners
dataset/train/48_66.wav|with the lens tend to work better than the flat sensors embedding under the screen so
dataset/train/48_67.wav|that's good. The loudspeaker's next and in what looks like a world first, ZTE has put
dataset/train/48_68.wav|thermal paste underneath their loudspeaker. Either the Axon 30's sound system is so bump
dataset/train/48_69.wav|and it needs cooling, or it could just be that the paste is used to dampen vibrations.
dataset/train/48_70.wav|Probably option two, but still pretty interesting.
dataset/train/48_71.wav|The charging port board is pretty simple. It just has the USB-C port, a SIM card tray,
dataset/train/48_72.wav|and that lower microphone. The battery inside of the Axon 30 does not have any visible pull
dataset/train/48_73.wav|tabs, so I'll drip some isopropyl alcohol below that battery to help dissolve any adhesive.
dataset/train/48_74.wav|It's not my favorite way of doing things, but it is safer than brute force. The battery
dataset/train/48_75.wav|is 4,200 milliamp hours and can charge at 55 watts thanks to the dual charging plugs
dataset/train/48_76.wav|up top. Finally, if you remember during the bend test there was a large cracking noise
dataset/train/48_77.wav|that happened while the phone was flexing. It obviously still survived that crack, but
dataset/train/48_78.wav|it looks like that noise emanated from the portion of the frame between the power button
dataset/train/48_79.wav|and the volume buttons. Not catastrophic to the functionality of the phone, but it was
dataset/train/48_80.wav|still definitely pretty close to being catastrophic and still something to watch out for.
dataset/train/48_81.wav|As far as the water resistance goes, it does have the normal rubber around the charging
dataset/train/48_82.wav|port and SIM card tray, but no official IP rating. The water damage indicator stickers
dataset/train/48_83.wav|are here next to the little circular vibrator and over here on the motherboard as well.
dataset/train/48_84.wav|They turn pink when they get wet. Personally, I like ZTE's ambition, trying out new things
dataset/train/48_85.wav|before everyone else. These guys also made that dual screen phone with the display on
dataset/train/48_86.wav|both the front and the back. That one was pretty cool. I'm glad that in a world of regular
dataset/train/48_87.wav|rectangles, ZTE is keeping things interesting. With all the screws back in place, even the
dataset/train/48_88.wav|hidden ones, we can turn the phone back on, plug it in, and ZTE has that 50 watts of power
dataset/train/48_89.wav|coming in up to the decimal place which is pretty cool to watch it charge. We can position
dataset/train/48_90.wav|the back plastics, and with that huge apple on the back, it's kind of hard to tell this
dataset/train/48_91.wav|is an Android phone. Luckily everything still works.
dataset/train/48_92.wav|Underscreen cameras just keep getting better and better so keep that in mind. Huge thanks
dataset/train/48_93.wav|to Mech Arena for sponsoring this video. Their link is down in the description. And come
dataset/train/48_94.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/49_1.wav|In front of us we have a OnePlus smartphone – not the OnePlus 9 though, or the OnePlus Nord 2.
dataset/train/49_2.wav|This guy is called the OnePlus Nord N200, and it's ridiculously inexpensive, which is probably why
dataset/train/49_3.wav|OnePlus doesn't really mention it. Speaking of inexpensive, if you've ordered one of my
dataset/train/49_4.wav|Jerryrig knives in the last few months, they are still coming. The shipment is just delayed until
dataset/train/49_5.wav|probably September. The world is still waking up from Covid. Link is down in the description.
dataset/train/49_6.wav|Where was I? Oh yeah. The Nord N200 is a full fledged OnePlus phone that only costs $230, which
dataset/train/49_7.wav|is incredibly cheap for a brand new OnePlus. So today we're going to find out what this thing is
dataset/train/49_8.wav|really made of. Inside the box we get a standard USB-C charging cable, and an 18 watt fast charger.
dataset/train/49_9.wav|The phone itself is a pretty low key Satin Blue color. Sometimes mid range and budget phones have
dataset/train/49_10.wav|a little more drip, if you catch my drift. But that doesn't seem to be the case here. OnePlus
dataset/train/49_11.wav|is playing it safe. So how does OnePlus make an entire phone for $230? I'm going to assume there's
dataset/train/49_12.wav|a lot of plastic involved. But there's only one way to find out for sure. Let's get started.
dataset/train/49_13.wav|Right off the bat I think I found one of the reasons why this phone is so cheap. These rear
dataset/train/49_14.wav|cameras are minisual. I'll talk more about the specs in a second, but a good rule of thumb is
dataset/train/49_15.wav|that the bigger the sensor, the nicer the camera. And while this Nord N200 has really big lenses on
dataset/train/49_16.wav|the outside, the camera in the center is just a pinprick of glass. They are much smaller than the
dataset/train/49_17.wav|cameras we find on full fledged flagships. We'll have to dig more into that during the teardown.
dataset/train/49_18.wav|Let's start with the scratch test. At $230 I would not be surprised at all if this guy
dataset/train/49_19.wav|had a plastic screen. What is surprising though is that this N200 isn't even the
dataset/train/49_20.wav|cheapest phone that OnePlus sells. They also have an N100 that costs about $150 bucks,
dataset/train/49_21.wav|but it caps out at 4G. This N200 is 5G internally, and externally we're seeing scratches at a level
dataset/train/49_22.wav|6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. So the screen is indeed made of glass. Nice work so far.
dataset/train/49_23.wav|A soft plastic display would get scratched up pretty quick.
dataset/train/49_24.wav|The front facing 16 megapixel camera is protected under the front glass. The earpiece grill is made
dataset/train/49_25.wav|from plastic and won't be falling out on it's own. And then, of course, about what we expected,
dataset/train/49_26.wav|the frame of the N200 is made from painted plastic soft enough that my razor blade can shave out
dataset/train/49_27.wav|large chunks. There is a side mounted capacitive fingerprint scanner which can also be scratched.
dataset/train/49_28.wav|Then up at the top we have more painted plastic. Over here on the left side we have more plastic,
dataset/train/49_29.wav|including the volume buttons, everything is plastic.
dataset/train/49_30.wav|We're also missing the mute slider which is pretty much a staple on every other
dataset/train/49_31.wav|OnePlus phone. Kind of sad to see it didn't make it onto the N200.
dataset/train/49_32.wav|The SIM card tray is pretty much the longest and largest we've ever seen.
dataset/train/49_33.wav|The N200 does have expandable storage, but no rubber ring around the SIM opening,
dataset/train/49_34.wav|which means there probably isn't any water protection on this guy either.
dataset/train/49_35.wav|The bottom of the phone has it's USB-C port, along with a loudspeaker and a headphone jack. Nice.
dataset/train/49_36.wav|The back of the phone feels as smooth as glass at first, but in reality it's also made from plastic.
dataset/train/49_37.wav|Plastic isn't bad, of course...well on cell phones at least. Single use plastics from restaurants,
dataset/train/49_38.wav|grocery stores and gas stations are pretty much destroying the planet. I mean it's kind of strange
dataset/train/49_39.wav|to think that every toothbrush you've ever used is still sitting in a landfill somewhere.
dataset/train/49_40.wav|But that's a video for a different day. Plastics on cellphones doesn't mean it's inherently weaker.
dataset/train/49_41.wav|We've had just as many metal phones snap in half as plastic phones have. Here on my channel
dataset/train/49_42.wav|it could go either way...just a roll of the dice. And we're here to see which way it falls.
dataset/train/49_43.wav|Moving up to the camera lens durability, we have the main 13 megapixel camera up top,
dataset/train/49_44.wav|then a 2 megapixel macro camera, and a 2 megapixel depth camera. And if you're keeping track,
dataset/train/49_45.wav|that means the camera with the most megapixels is actually on the front. That's strange.
dataset/train/49_46.wav|The rear camera also only films in 1080p. And they're still all protected by the comically
dataset/train/49_47.wav|large camera lens circles that are pretending to be something they aren't...like a V8 decal
dataset/train/49_48.wav|on your truck, or a spoiler on a Civic, the larger circles always look more expensive
dataset/train/49_49.wav|and costumes are fun. You can't blame OnePlus for trying to spice things up at this price point.
dataset/train/49_50.wav|If you really want to use a costume to spice things up though, I recommend my Teardown Skin
dataset/train/49_51.wav|from dbrand. It takes the dress up game to a whole new level by showing off the internals
dataset/train/49_52.wav|of your phone safely from the outside. I'll leave a link down in the description. We carry the skin
dataset/train/49_53.wav|for pretty much every popular phone nowadays and it does a pretty good job of hiding scratches,
dataset/train/49_54.wav|or better, keeping scratches from even happening in the first place.
dataset/train/49_55.wav|Even though this is a $230 smartphone, OnePlus has managed to slip a high 90hz refresh rate
dataset/train/49_56.wav|onto the 6.5 inch 1080p screen. And we can tell by the way the pixels go black and turn off
dataset/train/49_57.wav|that the display is IPS. After about 10 seconds when the flame is removed, the pixels do return
dataset/train/49_58.wav|back to normal. Lastly, before the bend test, let's check the fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/49_59.wav|It's over on the side and doubles as the power button, which I do prefer.
dataset/train/49_60.wav|Making the scanner the power button is just one less button push if the scanner happens
dataset/train/49_61.wav|to fail the scan...which does happen fairly often on underscreen fingerprint scanners.
dataset/train/49_62.wav|Adding some very deep scratches to the capacitive power button doesn't seem
dataset/train/49_63.wav|to deter the scanning capabilities too much. I'll give it a thumbs up.
dataset/train/49_64.wav|Now for the bend test. The regular OnePlus Nord, which is about twice as expensive as
dataset/train/49_65.wav|this Nord N200, failed my durability test last year. The phone itself survived, but the display
dataset/train/49_66.wav|underneath the glass cracked, rendering the phone unusable. With the first bend of the
dataset/train/49_67.wav|N200 we do get some flex, but no catastrophic damage just yet. When bending from the back,
dataset/train/49_68.wav|something does indeed snap, but whatever it is is not visible from the outside, nor does
dataset/train/49_69.wav|it inhibit the overall function of the device. The Nord N200 is still intact and still alive.
dataset/train/49_70.wav|We'll have to see what popped during the tear down. The N200 survives my durability test.
dataset/train/49_71.wav|Interesting to see a $230 smartphone survive where $1,000 smartphones could not. Nice work, OnePlus.
dataset/train/49_72.wav|I can see why you'd want to keep this one a secret. If too many people find out about it
dataset/train/49_73.wav|they might prefer it over the flagships. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. Besides the
dataset/train/49_74.wav|little cameras pretending to be big cameras, it's a pretty solid unit. I'm curious though, for
dataset/train/49_75.wav|those watching this video, when you go to buy a smartphone how much are you willing to spend? Let
dataset/train/49_76.wav|me know down in the comments. I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skins in the video description.
dataset/train/49_77.wav|And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/5_1.wav|The last laptop I bought was back in 2019 – a maxed out workhorse of a machine that I could
dataset/train/5_2.wav|use while traveling. Unfortunately though I didn't do a whole lot of traveling in 2020
dataset/train/5_3.wav|for some reason. But it has been a while and it's time for a new laptop since I do do a lot
dataset/train/5_4.wav|of work from a computer. Lenovo has sent over their latest Generation 7 Yoga Slim 7i Carbon
dataset/train/5_5.wav|with internal carbon fiber and magnesium. That special blend getting the weight of this laptop
dataset/train/5_6.wav|to just 960 grams, which makes it one of the world's lightest laptops even lighter than
dataset/train/5_7.wav|the MacBook Air. But like I always say, it's impossible to truly appreciate the beauty on
dataset/train/5_8.wav|the outside without first analysing the inside. I think it's time for a teardown. Let's get started.
dataset/train/5_9.wav|Now at first glance we don't see any carbon fiber on the exterior of the Yoga Slim's 7i Carbon. The
dataset/train/5_10.wav|exterior is the metal magnesium alloy. And while magnesium is the lightest of the structural
dataset/train/5_11.wav|metals, it's not as light as carbon fiber, which hopefully we'll find in a second as we
dataset/train/5_12.wav|dive deeper. There is a webcam kill switch, power button, and USB-C port here on the right side.
dataset/train/5_13.wav|On the other side near the Lenovo logo, we have the thunderbolt 4 connector, four super fast 40
dataset/train/5_14.wav|gigabit per second bi-directional data transfers, and this port also includes the USB-C form factor
dataset/train/5_15.wav|for charging, which is incredibly useful since a phone charger can now double as a laptop charger.
dataset/train/5_16.wav|We'll get to that more in a second. I'll do some desktop cleanup and it looks like we're working
dataset/train/5_17.wav|with the 12th generation Intel Core i7 with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a touch screen. Kind of
dataset/train/5_18.wav|cool. But like I said earlier, it's more fun to see hardware instead of reading about it.
dataset/train/5_19.wav|The bottom metal plate of the Lenovo Slim 7i Carbon is held in place by 65 screws,
dataset/train/5_20.wav|and I'm like 92% sure I told Lenovo I'd be taking this apart, so hopefully this void
dataset/train/5_21.wav|sticker doesn't matter too much. Along with the screws there's a series of clasps securing the
dataset/train/5_22.wav|panel which when finally unclipped give us full view and access to the internals, which at first
dataset/train/5_23.wav|glance are refreshingly modular. However, with regards to our request to find carbon, we are
dataset/train/5_24.wav|still searching. For the entire bottom panel at least is the metal magnesium alloy on both sides.
dataset/train/5_25.wav|Let's remove the battery. This guy is 48.5 watt hours which is about the equivalent of 4 iPhone
dataset/train/5_26.wav|4 batteries. And there are 5 phillips head screws holding down the plastic bracket that
dataset/train/5_27.wav|the batteries adhere to. The 36,290 milliamp hours give the Carbon laptop up to 13 hours of battery
dataset/train/5_28.wav|life, and the ability to get 4 hours of usage with just 30 minutes of charging. And coincidentally,
dataset/train/5_29.wav|it looks like the battery itself has 4 cells inside. Underneath the modular battery we have
dataset/train/5_30.wav|the modular trackpad and it looks like a modular expandable M.2 SSD slot. It's
dataset/train/5_31.wav|super refreshing to see off-the-shelf consumer replaceable harddrives. This guy is one terabyte
dataset/train/5_32.wav|so plenty sufficient storage space for now, but a few years down the road you never know.
dataset/train/5_33.wav|It's good to know the harddrive is upgradable. The next thing that needs to be removed in our
dataset/train/5_34.wav|search for carbon fiber is the cooling system. With three screws holding down the Slim fan,
dataset/train/5_35.wav|which also doubles as some cable management for latch style ribbon cables. It's very similar to
dataset/train/5_36.wav|the tiny fans we see inside of the Red Magic phone. Personally I'm not going to count the
dataset/train/5_37.wav|blades but if someone else wants to pause the video and let us know down in the comments
dataset/train/5_38.wav|that would be awesome. Thanks in advance. I'm still not seeing any carbon fiber. However,
dataset/train/5_39.wav|I do see a blacked out heat pipe. The whole matte black layout is enticingly aesthetic
dataset/train/5_40.wav|for something that not many people get to see unless you're subscribed to my channel of course.
dataset/train/5_41.wav|With the four screws removed that were holding down the CPU cooler,
dataset/train/5_42.wav|we can see that it is indeed made from copper. The fan pushes air through the
dataset/train/5_43.wav|fins on the end of the snaky looking tube to help keep that processor cool. The processor,
dataset/train/5_44.wav|which is the 12th generation Intel Core i7 that we saw earlier when the computer was turned on,
dataset/train/5_45.wav|is soldered to the main board. This guy gives us 32% faster real world productivity with 3x
dataset/train/5_46.wav|faster photo and video editing when compared to an average 2 year old laptop. The processor
dataset/train/5_47.wav|is not removable like we see on desktop computers, but that's pretty normal on laptops. They're built
dataset/train/5_48.wav|more like smartphones for better portability. To get the motherboard out we can remove a few more
dataset/train/5_49.wav|phillips head screws, detach the wire cables from the modular Wi-Fi 6 slot, which has 3x
dataset/train/5_50.wav|the transmillison rate of Wi-Fi 5, which probably won't matter too much for the people who come to
dataset/train/5_51.wav|the internet just for memes. But Wi-Fi 6 is a huge deal when it comes to moving large files quickly.
dataset/train/5_52.wav|With the motherboard disconnected we can see a large copper shield on the back,
dataset/train/5_53.wav|just loosely protecting the backside of the motherboard.
dataset/train/5_54.wav|Nothing too crazy. I did think it was cool though that each of the dual stereo speakers
dataset/train/5_55.wav|have three blue vibration isolating rubber bushings installed. Kind of nifty. There's
dataset/train/5_56.wav|another large black sticker under the motherboard which separates the electronics from the back
dataset/train/5_57.wav|side of the keypad. But so far there's still no carbon fiber. Everything we've seen so far is
dataset/train/5_58.wav|made from the magnesium alloy, which is great, that's still super lightweight. But with the
dataset/train/5_59.wav|word carbon in the literal name of the laptop, it has to be around here somewhere. The only
dataset/train/5_60.wav|place left to check is behind the screen. And this is where things get dangerous.
dataset/train/5_61.wav|Laptop screens are not normally very replaceable. The back side of the Yoga Slim 7i Carbon does have
dataset/train/5_62.wav|a few simple screws holding the screen hinge to the keyboard portion, but since our hinge is fine,
dataset/train/5_63.wav|we just need the panel to come out. And we can get away with just popping off the bezel. No screws
dataset/train/5_64.wav|this time around so I'll add some heat, since it's most likely only adhesive holding everything in
dataset/train/5_65.wav|place. I fully anticipate that this laptop is living out its final minutes. Since displays
dataset/train/5_66.wav|are usually the most fragile thing inside of laptops, just like on smartphones. But with
dataset/train/5_67.wav|how modular everything else is inside of this Yoga Carbon, I can always hope. With some of
dataset/train/5_68.wav|my plastic pry tools underneath the back panel and a few extra flashes of heat, I can tell we
dataset/train/5_69.wav|might be onto something. The 13 inch 90hz display is still incredibly fragile, but there is a metal
dataset/train/5_70.wav|back plate here to increase the rigidity. And without any visible cracks, I think the display
dataset/train/5_71.wav|might have just survived. As far as the carbon fiber goes, I think we finally found it. It's back
dataset/train/5_72.wav|here in just the top half of the laptop. Lenovo is calling this material the second gen webcore 2.0,
dataset/train/5_73.wav|which takes a 20-step bonding process and 8 hours of high heat baking to manufacture. Aesthetically
dataset/train/5_74.wav|it looks like a unidirectional non-woven carbon fiber which does provide the lightness
dataset/train/5_75.wav|and stiffness the laptop needs, even if it's not the aesthetic weave we normally see on vehicles,
dataset/train/5_76.wav|or where carbon fiber components are more visible. Carbon fiber is lighter than metal,
dataset/train/5_77.wav|while providing similar strength and rigidity. However, I imagine we're
dataset/train/5_78.wav|only seeing carbon fiber on one half of the laptop because of the thermal conductivity.
dataset/train/5_79.wav|The screen side of the laptop needs the rigidness, but the bottom side needs to be able to dissipate
dataset/train/5_80.wav|heat generated by the components. And carbon fiber tends to be more of a thermal insulator,
dataset/train/5_81.wav|which is a good reason to not use it on the bottom portion of the laptop where all the
dataset/train/5_82.wav|heat is generated. It's a pretty cool setup, and fun seeing different technologies and processes
dataset/train/5_83.wav|come into play to create something unique. Fingers crossed it's still functioning when I put it back
dataset/train/5_84.wav|together because I am rather attached to it now. With the ribbons back in place and a dollop of
dataset/train/5_85.wav|new thermal paste for the vapor chamber, I can get the can reassembled and the battery put back into
dataset/train/5_86.wav|place. Laptops have come a long way. There's a lot of power here in a very small package.
dataset/train/5_87.wav|The metal magnesium panel gets slapped on the bottom again with a few screws keeping it tight.
dataset/train/5_88.wav|And I promise I'm just as surprised as you are. The Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Carbon is still alive,
dataset/train/5_89.wav|intact, and fully functioning, ready to get to work. I'll leave a link down in the
dataset/train/5_90.wav|video description, if you're curious about the current pricing on Lenovo's new carbon laptop.
dataset/train/5_91.wav|And huge thanks to Lenovo for sending this over. I'll make sure it gets put to good use
dataset/train/5_92.wav|here in the new shop. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang
dataset/train/5_93.wav|out with me on Instagram if you're bored. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/50_1.wav|So I never break phones on accident, but last week I broke my personal phone twice doing very normal
dataset/train/50_2.wav|things. This crack over here wasn't a big deal, I was just lifting a chair out of the back of a car,
dataset/train/50_3.wav|which is something I do often. As I lift the chair out of the vehicle, the chair rests on my pocket
dataset/train/50_4.wav|which has my phone in it. And after two years of doing that repetitively, it broke my screen.
dataset/train/50_5.wav|I was just going to leave it since it's cosmetic and everything still works. But a couple days
dataset/train/50_6.wav|later I broke my phone again. My phone slid out of my pocket while sitting down in my office chair,
dataset/train/50_7.wav|and the edge of my screen hit the wheel of my chair and then fell onto carpet. But when the
dataset/train/50_8.wav|edge of the screen came in contact with the wheel, it shattered the side of the phone and broke more
dataset/train/50_9.wav|than just the glass...which rendered my phone pretty much useless. Without a screen there's
dataset/train/50_10.wav|not a whole lot you can do. So now we have two options. I could go get another phone. It has been
dataset/train/50_11.wav|two years, so I could kind of buy another phone relatively guilt-free. Usually, I like to use my
dataset/train/50_12.wav|phone for a bit longer. But two years is nothing to frown upon and it's what most of you suggested
dataset/train/50_13.wav|over on Twitter. But I got to thinking...iFixit has said if every single American were to keep
dataset/train/50_14.wav|their phone for an extra year, it would take the equivalent of 600,000 cars off the road. Which is
dataset/train/50_15.wav|a pretty big deal. And my mom always says, “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.”
dataset/train/50_16.wav|And she's a pretty big deal. But unfortunately though, my phone cannot make do anymore since
dataset/train/50_17.wav|the screen is one of the more important parts of a cellphone. So it's time to get a little creative
dataset/train/50_18.wav|and see if we can Frankenstein this thing back together with one of my durability tested phones
dataset/train/50_19.wav|that you've seen here previously about 2 years ago. Sometimes using a donor phone for parts is
dataset/train/50_20.wav|cheaper than buying brand new replacement parts. This is a Note 10 Plus 5G so who knows, maybe I'll
dataset/train/50_21.wav|have 5G once I'm done with the repair. There's only one way to find out. Let's get started.
dataset/train/50_22.wav|Frankensteining things together is actually kind of fun, it's the act of taking two broken phones
dataset/train/50_23.wav|and splicing them into one to make a working device. Just like a pick a part automotive junk
dataset/train/50_24.wav|yard where you can go in and grab the parts you need off of a wrecked vehicle so you can keep your
dataset/train/50_25.wav|own vehicle running longer. The unicorn sneeze colored Note 10 Plus is an international phone
dataset/train/50_26.wav|so it won't work with my carrier here in the USA. It doesn't have the right antennas for me to just
dataset/train/50_27.wav|plop my SIM card into. But I'm hoping at least the screen and the frame part are interchangeable,
dataset/train/50_28.wav|even if it has been scratched up and durability tested two years ago.
dataset/train/50_29.wav|I'll take the Teardown Skin off my non-psychedelic black phone and it looks like I've been a lot
dataset/train/50_30.wav|harder on my phone than I thought. My back glass is also shattered...probably because I've been
dataset/train/50_31.wav|double bagging it with a skin and a case which most likely puts a lot of extra pressure on that
dataset/train/50_32.wav|rear glass. Definitely not doing that anymore. Plus I've been keeping my gym key card tucked
dataset/train/50_33.wav|into the case, which adds even more stress. All things that I will avoid doing from now on.
dataset/train/50_34.wav|If I can bring my phone back to life, I'm going to be a whole lot nicer to it.
dataset/train/50_35.wav|Normally when I tear down a phone there's no emotional attachment,
dataset/train/50_36.wav|but this guy has been in my pocket for two years now, so I'm really hoping that it'll live again.
dataset/train/50_37.wav|With some heat from my heat gun and slices from my razor knife,
dataset/train/50_38.wav|we can soften and remove the adhesive holding the cracked back glass in place.
dataset/train/50_39.wav|And then we can do the same thing to the melted pile of skittles over here. It's much easier and
dataset/train/50_40.wav|quicker since it was already taken apart once a few years ago. So far things are looking positive.
dataset/train/50_41.wav|The screw holes appear to be in the same positions on both phones even though they are international
dataset/train/50_42.wav|and domestic variance. Not the kind of variance that concern the TVA of course, but the screw
dataset/train/50_43.wav|holes being in the same locations mean that the motherboard transplant might be feasible.
dataset/train/50_44.wav|Each Note 10 Plus has 9 screws holding down the back plastics and wireless charger over
dataset/train/50_45.wav|the motherboard. I almost forgot to show you the boot screen, which as you can see is locked
dataset/train/50_46.wav|to an SK telecom in South Korea. Not super useful if I want to use it here in the USA.
dataset/train/50_47.wav|I'll pop off all the little ribbon connectors just like little Lego's.
dataset/train/50_48.wav|And then do the same thing for my own phone, with it's 9 screws and little ribbons.
dataset/train/50_49.wav|I can remove the SIM card trays and then pop out the stacked motherboard with their
dataset/train/50_50.wav|attached camera modules. I kind of forgot that I sliced up and removed the copper vapor chamber
dataset/train/50_51.wav|during the teardown. I'm realizing that I'm not very nice to phones in general.
dataset/train/50_52.wav|I'll steel the vapor chamber from my old phone and slap it into the kaleidoscope.
dataset/train/50_53.wav|And luckily, even with the different chips and antennas, my US variant motherboard fits
dataset/train/50_54.wav|inside of the international frame. This might just work after all.
dataset/train/50_55.wav|As far as 5G goes though, as you can see, the slots for the 5G millimeter wave antennas
dataset/train/50_56.wav|are empty on my old phone, and they are also missing on the South Korean variant.
dataset/train/50_57.wav|So neither one of them has a super fast 5G and I won't end up with 5G after this is all over.
dataset/train/50_58.wav|Surprisingly though, the international phone with my own motherboard installed does turn on
dataset/train/50_59.wav|and shows the background of my old phone with all my apps and information. It's good to see
dataset/train/50_60.wav|them again. The problem though, which is kind of a big deal, is that I have no cell service,
dataset/train/50_61.wav|even after installing my SIM card. So we're going to have to try something else.
dataset/train/50_62.wav|The lack of cell signal could be one of two things: the phone could be looking for the
dataset/train/50_63.wav|charging port board, or more likely, it's looking for the back plastics which have
dataset/train/50_64.wav|the silver antennas lines baked on. To be on the safe side, I'll just move them all over.
dataset/train/50_65.wav|I'll plop my charging port board into the crayon box colored phone, along with my own loudspeaker,
dataset/train/50_66.wav|which as you can see has the silver antenna lines built onto the black plastics. I'll also make sure
dataset/train/50_67.wav|that I'm using the top plastics that previously covered the motherboard from my old phone since
dataset/train/50_68.wav|as we can see, the antenna lines on these parts are also different between the variants,
dataset/train/50_69.wav|and I need mine to work here in the USA. With all of the insides pretty much swapped over, we start
dataset/train/50_70.wav|delving into the metaphysical realm of the ship of Theseus. At one point did my phone stop being my
dataset/train/50_71.wav|phone, as the individual parts are replaced? The screen is different, the battery is different,
dataset/train/50_72.wav|and the frame is different. Even the color is different. But the insides, where it matters, my
dataset/train/50_73.wav|phone is indeed still the same, and surprisingly, still functional. You can even make phone calls.
dataset/train/50_74.wav| Hello.
dataset/train/50_75.wav|-How are you doing?
dataset/train/50_76.wav|-Can you hear me?
dataset/train/50_77.wav|-Yes I can. Can you hear me?
dataset/train/50_78.wav|-Yes. Did you have dinner?
dataset/train/50_79.wav|-Yeah, I did. I just fixed my phone. I'm just making sure it worked.
dataset/train/50_80.wav|-Oh. Alright. Well I'm on my way home.
dataset/train/50_81.wav|-Perfect. See you in a minute. Love ya.
dataset/train/50_82.wav|-Love you. Bye.
dataset/train/50_83.wav|-Not too shabby. There are still plenty of useful parts remaining in my previous phone,
dataset/train/50_84.wav|like the earpiece, battery, vibrator, and even the frame. It's always a good idea to
dataset/train/50_85.wav|recycle your phone. There's still plenty of value to even very broken phones. Even though
dataset/train/50_86.wav|my new phone now has scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7, a burn mark as well
dataset/train/50_87.wav|as scratches over the ultrasonic fingerprint reader, and no water resistance, I still very
dataset/train/50_88.wav|much prefer it to my totally broken display. And hopefully, this transplant will let me continue
dataset/train/50_89.wav|to use my phone for another year or two. “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.”
dataset/train/50_90.wav|I'm curious to know how long you've been using your current phone.
dataset/train/50_91.wav|Let me know down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/50_92.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/51_1.wav|Gaming phones are some of the most interesting and innovative phones on
dataset/train/51_2.wav|the market, especially when they have cool little gimmicks...like an internal cooling turbo fan.
dataset/train/51_3.wav|Today we'll be taking apart the Red Magic 6 to see how that fan works,
dataset/train/51_4.wav|and we'll do it with the phone turned on – alive through the whole operation. Let's get started.
dataset/train/51_5.wav|We know the fan sits on the left edge of the phone and blows air out through that side vent.
dataset/train/51_6.wav|But we do need physical access to it. Sometimes I speed up the glass removal part since it's a
dataset/train/51_7.wav|bit tedious. But today, since we're operating while the phone is still awake, I'll show you
dataset/train/51_8.wav|the whole process so you can hear if at any point the phone decides to kick the bucket, the fan will
dataset/train/51_9.wav|turn off as it blows it's last breath. Plus we can multitask with the perfect segue to our sponsor,
dataset/train/51_10.wav|Discord. Discord is releasing a new type of voice channel with real time audio-only conversations.
dataset/train/51_11.wav|It's called Stages. Groups of people like you and me can come hang out and chat together.
dataset/train/51_12.wav|Instead of just watching a video like we enjoy doing here on YouTube,
dataset/train/51_13.wav|we can actually interact with each other, asking questions and stuff in real time.
dataset/train/51_14.wav|I'll be hosting a live Discord Stage event on July 9th at 9:00PM mountain time. And if you want
dataset/train/51_15.wav|to come hang out, it's totally free to join. It only takes about 15 seconds to set up an account.
dataset/train/51_16.wav|We'll be talking about YouTube, electric cars, and maybe even a secret project I have planned
dataset/train/51_17.wav|for later this month. You know, normal stuff Q and A style. I think it will be fun. I'll leave
dataset/train/51_18.wav|an invite link in the description so you can add it to your calendar and I'll see you over there.
dataset/train/51_19.wav|And would you look at that, the glass is off. That was convenient. Plus everything is still
dataset/train/51_20.wav|alive. The fan's blowing more hot air than a politician in voting season. The fan looks
dataset/train/51_21.wav|to be pretty similar to last year's size-wise, except for the construction is totally different.
dataset/train/51_22.wav|The metal air chamber is still attached to the back glass plate,
dataset/train/51_23.wav|and you can see dollops of thermal paste that help the processors dissipate their heat into the metal
dataset/train/51_24.wav|chamber where that air flow is happening through it. The chamber helps keep the motherboard out
dataset/train/51_25.wav|of the air stream so it won't collect dust like a desktop computer does. Probably a good idea.
dataset/train/51_26.wav|I'll unplug the RGB's and we can get a closer look at this thin metal duct. The air flows
dataset/train/51_27.wav|into the phone frame, takes an abrupt 90 degree turn up towards the back glass into the vent,
dataset/train/51_28.wav|and then jets out the far side of the phone. The design has changed quite a bit over the years.
dataset/train/51_29.wav|Last year, with the Red Magic 5G, the cooling fan is generally in the same spot, but the duct work
dataset/train/51_30.wav|is larger and screwed down over the motherboard. The air is channeled between the metal duct and
dataset/train/51_31.wav|the glass. And the year before, the Red Magic 3 kept that same fan placement and size, but
dataset/train/51_32.wav|pulled the air in from the center of the panel, right below the camera module. Moving air does
dataset/train/51_33.wav|accomplish quite a lot when it comes to removing heat, especially while the phone is working hard.
dataset/train/51_34.wav|Now, this is where I realize that I've made a mistake. As you can hear the fan is still working,
dataset/train/51_35.wav|but I can't turn the phone off. Someone, I don't want to name names, sliced through the
dataset/train/51_36.wav|power cable during the back glass removal. So it looks like we'll have to pull the plug manually.
dataset/train/51_37.wav|And hopefully we'll find a way to turn the phone back on again after we're done because without a
dataset/train/51_38.wav|power button, that becomes extremely difficult. With the metal plate holding down the battery's
dataset/train/51_39.wav|ribbon is removed, I can unplug the dual battery connectors, along with the broken power button,
dataset/train/51_40.wav|side volume buttons, USB-C port and extension ribbon. There are 7 more screws holding down
dataset/train/51_41.wav|the top plastics. These are all different sizes. Then I can pop off the back panel
dataset/train/51_42.wav|which exposes the motherboard. Then I can remove 7 more screws surrounding the bottom plastics,
dataset/train/51_43.wav|which can also come off releasing the large copper sheet that covers the battery and the plugs.
dataset/train/51_44.wav|One more screw holds down the bottom board. And then I can unsnap the fingerprint reader, wire
dataset/train/51_45.wav|cable, and pull out the SIM card tray. The USB-C charging port is capable of charging at 66 watts.
dataset/train/51_46.wav|It's on it's own little ribbon and does have a rubber ring around the tip
dataset/train/51_47.wav|which will help with the water resistance with at least one point on the phone.
dataset/train/51_48.wav|The plastic loudspeaker also has some black water proofing mesh over the opening,
dataset/train/51_49.wav|which will help with water as well, but doesn't have any foam balls.
dataset/train/51_50.wav|Before we can get a good look at the fan, we need to remove the battery. Nubia fails in this aspect
dataset/train/51_51.wav|with how much glue they've added. It makes repair and recycling much more difficult, but with some
dataset/train/51_52.wav|isopropyl alcohol we can start dissolving the adhesive before prying it out from the frame.
dataset/train/51_53.wav|The battery has dual plugs and a 5,050 milliamp hour capacity.
dataset/train/51_54.wav|Finally, the motherboard. The Red Magic 6 has an 8 megapixel selfie camera...and
dataset/train/51_55.wav|a headphone jack. The headphone jack also has a clear rubber gasket around
dataset/train/51_56.wav|the opening to help seal the hole. Not too shabby on water resistance so far.
dataset/train/51_57.wav|The backside of the motherboard has 2 wire ribbons and a regular ribbon that can just
dataset/train/51_58.wav|unclip like a little Lego. Then we're free to scope out the triple camera setup. We have an
dataset/train/51_59.wav|8 megapixel ultra wide camera up top, then a 65 megapixel camera in the middle, and a 2
dataset/train/51_60.wav|megapixel macro camera down at the bottom – none of which have OIS. I'll set this down gently.
dataset/train/51_61.wav|With the motherboard out of the way we see quite a bit of thermal paste,
dataset/train/51_62.wav|helping even more heat escape from underneath the screen side of the phone. And, of course,
dataset/train/51_63.wav|we still have our little fan friend who is very securely glued into the frame of the phone.
dataset/train/51_64.wav|Which makes sense. It's a moving part and needs to be secure. But that won't stop us from getting a
dataset/train/51_65.wav|better look. If there is water resistance, we're going to find it. The probably with making the
dataset/train/51_66.wav|fan water tight is that would mean that the air flow would also be severely restricted.
dataset/train/51_67.wav|The Legion Duel 2 gaming phone managed to make their phone with two internal cooling fans IP 58.
dataset/train/51_68.wav|But, it also snapped in half. So you win some, you lose some. The Red Magic 6's fan is shaped kind of
dataset/train/51_69.wav|like a turbo fan on a jet engine, which means it can move quite a lot of air in a very small space.
dataset/train/51_70.wav|But, judging by the lack of water proofing mesh, it's pretty safe to assume that this
dataset/train/51_71.wav|fan could also act as a boat propeller – sucking water into the phone just like it would air.
dataset/train/51_72.wav|Which makes it kind of the opposite of water resistant, especially if the fan is turned on
dataset/train/51_73.wav|under water. Neither side of the duct has any protection. Nubia would have to find a way to
dataset/train/51_74.wav|seal the duct work to the fans in order to get the water protection that other flagships have.
dataset/train/51_75.wav|But, you know, water resistance isn't important to everybody. But something that is important to
dataset/train/51_76.wav|everyone is a working power button. I have severe doubts about this thing ever turning on again now
dataset/train/51_77.wav|that the power button is sliced. With the battery back in place and the top plastic screwed in,
dataset/train/51_78.wav|along with the bottom plastics and loudspeaker, we can give it a try....and nothing. Plugging
dataset/train/51_79.wav|in the phone will sometimes turn a phone on, but this Red Magic 6 just goes to a charging screen,
dataset/train/51_80.wav|which means it's kind of turned on, I guess. Not something people usually want to hear.
dataset/train/51_81.wav|I can try going to the boot menu and power things on. But even in here we need the power button to
dataset/train/51_82.wav|select reboot system now. Not very helpful. A sliced power button is rather inconvenient.
dataset/train/51_83.wav|We do have a rather long shot option though. The volume button ribbon and the power button
dataset/train/51_84.wav|ribbon have the same sized plugs, and a button is pretty much a button. So if I
dataset/train/51_85.wav|stretch the volume button ribbon over to the power button plug...gently of course,
dataset/train/51_86.wav|since the only thing worse than one torn ribbon is two torn ribbons. I can use one
dataset/train/51_87.wav|of the volume buttons as the power button. And very surprisingly, to me especially, it works.
dataset/train/51_88.wav|If anything deserves a thumbs up, it's that. And even after everything I've done to this phone,
dataset/train/51_89.wav|it's still alive and well, with the fan spinning up a storm. Nice work, Nubia.
dataset/train/51_90.wav|Good to know that if I ever need to turn on or off this phone in the future,
dataset/train/51_91.wav|I just need to completely disassemble it, swap the volume and power button ribbons
dataset/train/51_92.wav|and I'm good to go. Easy. The Red Magic 6 is very well constructed from both the inside as well as
dataset/train/51_93.wav|the outside. I'm curious, does your own phone ever get hot? Let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/51_94.wav|Don't forget to come join the hangout on Discord. I'll leave that linked down in
dataset/train/51_95.wav|the description. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/52_1.wav|Today we have something interesting. Apple's been using wireless charging now for about 4 years,
dataset/train/52_2.wav|but only recently did they start adding some pretty sweet looking magnets to the
dataset/train/52_3.wav|back of their iPhones to facilitate the process. You can tell by the circle of
dataset/train/52_4.wav|magnets that surround the outer edge of the copper induction coil. I'm a little biased,
dataset/train/52_5.wav|of course, but I think it makes my Teardown Skin for the iPhone look super cool.
dataset/train/52_6.wav|Well my channel's sponsor, Anker, decided to run with this new magnetic magsafe technology
dataset/train/52_7.wav|and threw some equally strong magnets inside of one of their power banks.
dataset/train/52_8.wav|So now there's no cords involved when you need some backup juice.
dataset/train/52_9.wav|It lines up by itself and magnetically stays attached to the phone with some pretty good
dataset/train/52_10.wav|force. Shaking it around from the phone side or even holding it by the charger, everything still
dataset/train/52_11.wav|stays connected. Today we're going to find out how this sorcery works from the inside
dataset/train/52_12.wav|and see if the PowerCore's magnets are oriented in the same direction as Apple's. Let's get started.
dataset/train/52_13.wav|The PowerCore 5K is pretty small. We'll get to the internal battery in just a second
dataset/train/52_14.wav|but the outside is covered with a grippy rubberized surface
dataset/train/52_15.wav|and feels pretty solid. It's got a power button that will turn on the wireless charging ability,
dataset/train/52_16.wav|and a few LED indicator lights that show how much charge is left inside of the bank, along
dataset/train/52_17.wav|with an additional USB-C port to charge other devices that might not be magsafe compatible.
dataset/train/52_18.wav|It looks like it only charges one device at a time. The wireless charging of the iPhone turns
dataset/train/52_19.wav|off when I plug in my Note 10 Plus, but it is nice to have options. There's another larger wireless
dataset/train/52_20.wav|power bank from Anker called the PowerCore 10K. It doesn't have the internal magnets, but it is
dataset/train/52_21.wav|still wireless and can charge three things at the same time. But today we're after those magnets.
dataset/train/52_22.wav|You might be asking yourself, 'Hey Jerry, how long do magnets even last?' And I'm
dataset/train/52_23.wav|glad you asked. Magnets, like the ones found inside of the iPhone and the Anker PowerCore,
dataset/train/52_24.wav|actually don't last forever. They lose about 1% of their holding power every hundred years or so.
dataset/train/52_25.wav|So in like 5,000 years, we'll drop to about 50% of the original holding capacity. Hit that subscribe
dataset/train/52_26.wav|button so you don't miss the video where we test that one out. You also might have noticed by now
dataset/train/52_27.wav|that this power bank is not designed to come apart. There is a seam around the outer edge
dataset/train/52_28.wav|and we're definitely making progress. But with everything glued shut, we need some brute force.
dataset/train/52_29.wav|So far we see some cushy foam tape inside of that plastic housing,
dataset/train/52_30.wav|kind of like the foam we saw inside of GM's electric hummer. And also, like that Hummer,
dataset/train/52_31.wav|Anker's power bank is using a pouch style lithium battery, like we see in most cell
dataset/train/52_32.wav|phones. 5,000 milliamp hours to be exact. And while this battery is indeed much larger than
dataset/train/52_33.wav|the iPhone 12's internal battery, due to the energy lost while using inductive charging,
dataset/train/52_34.wav|it'll be giving the iPhone about one full charge or 17 additional hours of video.
dataset/train/52_35.wav|The underside of the power bank is where things start to get more interesting. This is where we
dataset/train/52_36.wav|find the copper induction coil, as well as the neodymium magnets embedded into the back plastics.
dataset/train/52_37.wav|Let's start with the magnets. Personally, I didn't notice that the magsafe charger
dataset/train/52_38.wav|isn't just a circle of magnets. It's actually shaped like a flower, with a stem and then a
dataset/train/52_39.wav|circle of petals up top. The magnet at the base making up the stem of the flower is
dataset/train/52_40.wav|what keeps things aligned. And the circle part keeps things centered around that copper coil.
dataset/train/52_41.wav|Thumbs up for that. Learn something new every day. And it does a pretty good
dataset/train/52_42.wav|job. The tiny magnets from the power bank can support the full weight of the phone.
dataset/train/52_43.wav|Magnets are pretty crazy. Let's see if the coil will still function without the magnets...and
dataset/train/52_44.wav|it looks like it does. It doesn't lock on or center itself anymore,
dataset/train/52_45.wav|but can still act as a normal wireless charging pad, even with the exterior now removed.
dataset/train/52_46.wav|The coil itself is a bit thicker than the coils we normally find in smartphones,
dataset/train/52_47.wav|probably because it's giving power instead of just receiving it. It can charge up the phone
dataset/train/52_48.wav|at 5 watts, and looks like it's coated with some kind of soft, white material.
dataset/train/52_49.wav|Overall it's pretty cool. Interesting to see a full on powerbank adapting to the magsafe
dataset/train/52_50.wav|technology, even if it is only using 5 watts. If you want to charge faster, of course, Anker
dataset/train/52_51.wav|does have their Nano 2, which packs 45 watts of juice into a small little package. Charging with a
dataset/train/52_52.wav|cable is quite a bit more efficient than wireless charging, even if it is a little less futuristic.
dataset/train/52_53.wav|Either way, I think it was cool to explore the insides. Let me know if you want me to take
dataset/train/52_54.wav|apart one of those Nano 2's. I don't think we've ever done a charging brick before. Might be fun.
dataset/train/52_55.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching.
dataset/train/52_56.wav|I'll see you around.
dataset/train/53_1.wav|Today we're going to be taking apart a sapphire covered smartphone. Sapphire is a super rare,
dataset/train/53_2.wav|almost scratch proof material, with a hardness level right up there next to
dataset/train/53_3.wav|diamonds. And as you can tell, this is real sapphire. You could say it's ice.
dataset/train/53_4.wav|Sheeeeeeeeeeeesh
dataset/train/53_5.wav|Quick tip: you've probably seen one of these diamond testers on Tik Tok,
dataset/train/53_6.wav|and while they are really good at testing for gemstones and diamonds, they are very
dataset/train/53_7.wav|easy to manipulate. For example, if you see someone with their finger on the dial while they
dataset/train/53_8.wav|are testing something, there's a good chance that what they're testing is fake. My own smartphone
dataset/train/53_9.wav|does not have a sapphire screen and if I test it, the sensor doesn't beep, it doesn't do anything.
dataset/train/53_10.wav|But if I put my finger on the dial and adjust the sensitivity while it's not touching anything,
dataset/train/53_11.wav|it might seem as if my own smartphone has sapphire. And this works with gemstones and other
dataset/train/53_12.wav|precious diamonds and stuff. But if we go back to the Kyocera and my finger's not on the dial,
dataset/train/53_13.wav|and we can tell this is indeed the real deal. Now you can protect yourself from any funny business.
dataset/train/53_14.wav|You know who else likes to protect people from funny business?
dataset/train/53_15.wav|Bitdefender. Huge thanks to Bitdefender for sponsoring this video. Bitdefender
dataset/train/53_16.wav|is a cyber security leader delivering best in class prevention, protection,
dataset/train/53_17.wav|and response solutions world wide. Bitdefender offers protection and privacy without compromising
dataset/train/53_18.wav|your device's performance. Or, for as little as $3.34 a month, you can get webcam protection,
dataset/train/53_19.wav|microphone protection, and ransomware protection. Even parental controls. The parental protections
dataset/train/53_20.wav|include screen time limits and that works because Bitdefender can be utilized across
dataset/train/53_21.wav|multiple platforms simultaneously. Platforms meaning different systems like PC's, Macs,
dataset/train/53_22.wav|Androids, and iPhone. Bitdefender also comes with a VPN and monitors online threats in real time.
dataset/train/53_23.wav|And to sweeten the whole deal, new users get a 4 month free trial of Bitdefender Total Security.
dataset/train/53_24.wav|I'll put that link down in the video description. Protection is always a good thing,
dataset/train/53_25.wav|and it's better to have it before you need it. I'll have that link down below.
dataset/train/53_26.wav|With how rugged this Duraforce Ultra is, it should be difficult to take apart,
dataset/train/53_27.wav|but will also be different than anything we've ever seen. Let's get started.
dataset/train/53_28.wav|It's kind of refreshing to have a super rugged phone on the table,
dataset/train/53_29.wav|especially after having three phones break in half this year. But being ultra rugged might make it
dataset/train/53_30.wav|more difficult to open up. The sapphire on top is basically unscratchable which is bussin. And
dataset/train/53_31.wav|the phone itself is water resistant to 2 meters and has water damage covered under warranty,
dataset/train/53_32.wav|which pretty much no other smartphone brand does. Kyocera even calls it waterproof in their
dataset/train/53_33.wav|advertising instead of water resistant, which is something else no other manufacturer is doing.
dataset/train/53_34.wav|With 2 screws removed and my razor blade pulling off the back middle panel,
dataset/train/53_35.wav|we start seeing more internal silver screws. Twelve to be exact.
dataset/train/53_36.wav|The bottom gold contact points are to attach other accessories and docks that Kyocera makes. With the
dataset/train/53_37.wav|first round of screws removed we can start popping off the thick plastic and rubber side bumpers.
dataset/train/53_38.wav|This is what protects the phone and the hard sapphire from drops,
dataset/train/53_39.wav|like a built on case that's engineered to withstand 5 foot drops onto concrete.
dataset/train/53_40.wav|Removing the side and end bumpers reveals a few things, like some pretty cool looking gold antenna
dataset/train/53_41.wav|lines molded into the plastic, and 18 more screws. That's 32 screws total for people trying to keep
dataset/train/53_42.wav|track back at home. But check this out, separating the two halves of the Duraforce Ultra 5G
dataset/train/53_43.wav|reveals the most intense water protection that we've ever seen inside of a cell phone.
dataset/train/53_44.wav|A sticky rubber gasket inlaid into a groove all around the edges. Kyocera isn't messing around.
dataset/train/53_45.wav|The last time we saw something this intense was when we took apart an underwater drone
dataset/train/53_46.wav|designed to film and operate 100 feet underwater. Apparently the sticky hand technology is useful
dataset/train/53_47.wav|for more things than just getting stuck on the ceiling...it can also keep phones watertight.
dataset/train/53_48.wav|The other half of the phone contains the electronics. We have the 5G antennas – one
dataset/train/53_49.wav|at the top and either side of the phone. Then the wireless charger sitting on top of a hard battery.
dataset/train/53_50.wav|It's plugged in just like a little Lego. Kyocera is using hard plastic for the battery,
dataset/train/53_51.wav|which is something we haven't seen in a while,
dataset/train/53_52.wav|probably because it's more durable than the thinner pouch-style batteries.
dataset/train/53_53.wav|It also might have something to do with being certified non-incentive class 1 division 2
dataset/train/53_54.wav|which is a requirement for jobs where explosive concentration of flammable gases might exist.
dataset/train/53_55.wav|I do hope they pay extra for a job where using a regular phone might get you exploded.
dataset/train/53_56.wav|The battery is 4500 milliamp hours and has the wireless charging permanently glued to the top.
dataset/train/53_57.wav|We have two more screws holding down two massive speakers on the bottom of the phone.
dataset/train/53_58.wav|I'll unplug each of their connections and lift it up and out of the phone with the USB-C charger.
dataset/train/53_59.wav|These speakers are huge and they aren't even in boxes. No balls needed with woofers this large.
dataset/train/53_60.wav|And then we have the charging port with it's own red rubber ring, which further assists
dataset/train/53_61.wav|the ingress protection. Everything including the rear cameras still seem to be permanently
dataset/train/53_62.wav|attached to the motherboard. So I'll pull out another 5 screws bringing our total up to 38.
dataset/train/53_63.wav|Then we can unplug some latch-style connectors and remove the expandable
dataset/train/53_64.wav|memory and SIM card tray so we can pull the whole motherboard up and out of the phone.
dataset/train/53_65.wav|The cameras are tiny little guys and none of them have the optical image stabilization,
dataset/train/53_66.wav|which is kind of strange. You would think someone working underneath an active SpaceX launch would
dataset/train/53_67.wav|want some pictures. Everything else is pretty chill. The sapphire screen is embedded into
dataset/train/53_68.wav|the plastic frame, like we see most other phones doing with their glass screens, just Kyocera has
dataset/train/53_69.wav|some next level robustness. The little latches protecting the headphone jack and charging port
dataset/train/53_70.wav|just have little plastic tails held in place with the stopper. The Duraforce Ultra 5G definitely
dataset/train/53_71.wav|isn't the thinnest or the sleekest looking phone on the market, but it's built for a job. And from
dataset/train/53_72.wav|my perspective, it looks like it's very proficient at the job it was built for. And the repairability
dataset/train/53_73.wav|isn't that bad either. Everything is just held in place by screws like it was back in the good
dataset/train/53_74.wav|old days before heat guns were required. Since mine has been taken apart, I wouldn't consider
dataset/train/53_75.wav|it waterproof anymore and I'll probably never get this sticky hand of a gasket back into its correct
dataset/train/53_76.wav|location, but it's still a pretty cool system that Kyocera has implemented in their phone.
dataset/train/53_77.wav|One last little tidbit, most phones have super fine threads on their itty bitty screws
dataset/train/53_78.wav|like the one on the right from inside the carbon fiber phone.
dataset/train/53_79.wav|But Kyocera is over here using some very aggressive coarse thread.
dataset/train/53_80.wav|This allows for more plastic to sit in between the threads and gives us less of a probability
dataset/train/53_81.wav|for the tiny screw to strip out of its hole. And well, there are 30 of them back here. So combine
dataset/train/53_82.wav|the 30 screws with the coarse thread and I think things are pretty well held together.
dataset/train/53_83.wav|With the bottom, sides, and top body armor pieces back on the phone,
dataset/train/53_84.wav|we can get the back plate situated and it's time to turn things on. And everything works. This guy
dataset/train/53_85.wav|is basically scratch-proof, drop proof, water proof, and explosion resistant. If every phone
dataset/train/53_86.wav|was built like this it would probably put me out of a job. Nice work, Kyocera. Let me know down in
dataset/train/53_87.wav|the comments which of these features you'd like to see implemented in your own phone.
dataset/train/53_88.wav|Share this video with someone who's always breaking their device, and then come hang out
dataset/train/53_89.wav|with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/54_1.wav|So this has not been a good year for gaming phones. We've had the Legion Duel 2
dataset/train/54_2.wav|break, some catastrophic damage to the ROG Phone 5.
dataset/train/54_3.wav|We've had more phones break apart this year than any other year and it's only June. Today we have a
dataset/train/54_4.wav|new gaming phone, a new contender called the Red Magic 6. It's one of those phones with
dataset/train/54_5.wav|an internal cooling fan. So hopefully this one survives a little better than the last couple.
dataset/train/54_6.wav|Today's video is sponsored by Surfshark. Surfshark is a VPN that's easy to install
dataset/train/54_7.wav|and you use on unlimited devices simultaneously. You might be asking what is a VPN? A virtual
dataset/train/54_8.wav|private network allows you to encrypt your internet traffic while you're using public wi-fi,
dataset/train/54_9.wav|or access streaming services from outside the country so you can keep watching your shows while
dataset/train/54_10.wav|you're traveling...now that that's a thing again. A VPN just keeps your information safer. The best
dataset/train/54_11.wav|part though, if I can get nerdy for a second, is that Surfshark keeps no data logs with a 100%
dataset/train/54_12.wav|ram only server network. So your IP and location information and browsing are always protected.
dataset/train/54_13.wav|Just click the link down in the description and use the code “JerryRig” to get an 83%
dataset/train/54_14.wav|discount. And of course, if you don't like it there's always a 30 day money back guarantee.
dataset/train/54_15.wav|It works on iPhones, Androids, PCs, and Macs, all kinds of platforms including Play Stations,
dataset/train/54_16.wav|if that's where the kids are doing their internet these days. And you can get all
dataset/train/54_17.wav|of that for basically $2 a month. I'll leave a link down in the description. Now it's time to
dataset/train/54_18.wav|see if this new gaming phone performs better than the previous phones. Let's get started.
dataset/train/54_19.wav|This Red Magic 6 costs about $600, which is pretty fairly priced compared to some of the other gaming
dataset/train/54_20.wav|phones, and it has some pretty impressive specs as well. It is 5G this time around,
dataset/train/54_21.wav|which is something to consider now that there are more 5G towers in place. Inside the box
dataset/train/54_22.wav|we get a subtly shiny black smartphone, as well as a 30 watt quick charge charging brick
dataset/train/54_23.wav|and a red USB-C cable, along with some paperwork and a SIM card removal tool.
dataset/train/54_24.wav|Red Magic has kept this aesthetic for quite a while now with the cameras lined up vertically
dataset/train/54_25.wav|in the center of the phone. And they were the only ones for a while to have a built-in
dataset/train/54_26.wav|internal cooling fan to help keep the guts from overheating during long gaming sessions.
dataset/train/54_27.wav|There are no metal protrusions or flashy accents. This Red Magic 6 could sneak
dataset/train/54_28.wav|by as a regular smartphone unless someone was actively looking for it.
dataset/train/54_29.wav|To get the fan to turn on we flip a switch on the side of the phone,
dataset/train/54_30.wav|and it's pretty quiet. It's a singular fan. If you remember, the Legion Duel 2 had two
dataset/train/54_31.wav|fans inside..and it also snapped in half, so it's probably not the design we should be emulating.
dataset/train/54_32.wav|We'll test this more in a second. It wouldn't be a gaming phone without some RGBs. They are
dataset/train/54_33.wav|also quite a bit more subtle this time around, just some smaller light bars along the edges,
dataset/train/54_34.wav|and of course, the logo down at the bottom. Let's just into the durability test.
dataset/train/54_35.wav|Red Magic is nice enough to include a pretty nice looking screen protector.
dataset/train/54_36.wav|Once that's gone we can start scratching what Nubia's calling the world's smoothest smartphone,
dataset/train/54_37.wav|not due to the physical smoothness of the glass, but the digital smoothness of the display.
dataset/train/54_38.wav|This screen refreshes at 165 hertz, and has a peak touch sensitivity rate of 500 hertz...which for a
dataset/train/54_39.wav|gaming phone is pretty important and impressive. Pretty sure this is now the world leader in
dataset/train/54_40.wav|touch sensitivity. The screen can pretty much sense your finger before you sense your finger.
dataset/train/54_41.wav|Still scratches at level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7 though. There's no sapphire here.
dataset/train/54_42.wav|Up in the top bezel we have an 8 megapixel selfie camera,
dataset/train/54_43.wav|along with the plastic earpiece which won't be falling out on it's own. The bottom bezel
dataset/train/54_44.wav|is symmetrical, nothing super special down here. The special bits begin on the side.
dataset/train/54_45.wav|The Red Magic 6 has scratchable capacitive triggers along this right side of the phone.
dataset/train/54_46.wav|They don't magnetically pop up like we saw on the Black Shark 4, but they are very responsive with a
dataset/train/54_47.wav|touch sensitivity near 400 hertz. The buttons and fan vent are made from metal. The top of
dataset/train/54_48.wav|the phone has a headphone jack sitting inside a concave channel – similar to a blood groove on a
dataset/train/54_49.wav|medieval sword. Well that was dark. Then over here on the right side of the phone we have more metal,
dataset/train/54_50.wav|the volume rocker, the air intake, and the dedicated gaming button.
dataset/train/54_51.wav|The bottom of the phone has the stereos speaker, USB-C port, and SIM card tray,
dataset/train/54_52.wav|which does not have any removable storage.
dataset/train/54_53.wav|Fans inside of smartphones have always fascinated me. Moving air does a really
dataset/train/54_54.wav|good job of cooling things down. And as we can see, this blower has some force to it,
dataset/train/54_55.wav|scattering my little bits of shredded post-it note all over my desk. It's easy to tell where
dataset/train/54_56.wav|the fan is located on the phone when we stab it. I would make a terrible doctor.
dataset/train/54_57.wav|It makes noise when we jab it at one end, but not the other, so we can tell which sides it's on.
dataset/train/54_58.wav|Even after stabbing it 10 or so times, the fan is still alive.
dataset/train/54_59.wav|Thumbs up for that. Hopefully it will still be in one piece when we do the teardown.
dataset/train/54_60.wav|The back panel is made from glass, and then of course,
dataset/train/54_61.wav|we have three cameras sitting up here in a little row in the center of the phone.
dataset/train/54_62.wav|I'll turn off the fan. Up at the top we have the 64 megapixel main sensor that can film in 8K.
dataset/train/54_63.wav|And then we have the 8 megapixel ultra wide, and the 2 megapixel macro camera, all protected under
dataset/train/54_64.wav|the same piece of glass. Then, under the back piece of glass, we have a single LED triangular
dataset/train/54_65.wav|flash. The shape helps the prismatic fluorescence triangulate the luminescence.
dataset/train/54_66.wav|Just kidding – it's all aesthetic, but I bet you thought it was super cool for a second there.
dataset/train/54_67.wav|Besides the internal fan, the screen is probably the main selling point of the Red Magic 6,
dataset/train/54_68.wav|along with that 165 hertz refresh rate. It's also a 6.8 inch 10 bit with a billion colors
dataset/train/54_69.wav|1080p, and of course, lasts for about 23 seconds under the heat from my lighter
dataset/train/54_70.wav|before going white and not recovering. Red Magic also says this guy also has 4D shock inside,
dataset/train/54_71.wav|which might mean multiple vibrators. We'll have to check during the teardown.
dataset/train/54_72.wav|And the last test before the durability test, is the under screen fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/54_73.wav|We can see that it's optical by the light emitting from the portion of the screen that
dataset/train/54_74.wav|sits above the scanner sensor. It's illuminating the ridges of my fingerprint. And once it's set
dataset/train/54_75.wav|and working, we can add some heavy duty level 7 deeper grooves to the surface of the screen,
dataset/train/54_76.wav|which will be more damage than it would receive in normal everyday life.
dataset/train/54_77.wav|And impressively it's still working...even with how scuffed up my fingerprints are.
dataset/train/54_78.wav|Finally, the bend test, which apparently, for gaming phones is a hard test to survive this year.
dataset/train/54_79.wav|Seeing phones snap in half is almost harder to handle than Breath of the Wild being delayed for
dataset/train/54_80.wav|another year...again. Starting from the back there is hardly any movement in the frame.
dataset/train/54_81.wav|And bending from the front we get pretty much the same results. Turns out the Red
dataset/train/54_82.wav|Magic 6 is a solid piece of hardware that can handle the rigors of being a gaming phone.
dataset/train/54_83.wav|Nice work. It survives my durability test and brings the 2021 gaming phone survival rate to 50%.
dataset/train/54_84.wav|Let me know what other smartphones or gaming phones you want to see tested down in the
dataset/train/54_85.wav|comments. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. And come hang out
dataset/train/54_86.wav|with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/55_1.wav|Well, we're back again with another iPad...this time the bigger one. Will it suffer the same
dataset/train/55_2.wav|fate as the last two? Probably. Are we going to test it anyway? Definitely.
dataset/train/55_3.wav|There are a few major improvements to the iPad this year, the main one being the mini LED screen,
dataset/train/55_4.wav|but only on the bigger 12.9 inch tablet. We've never tested the larger size iPad before so it
dataset/train/55_5.wav|should be interesting. I'm curious to see how the new mini LED screen reacts to the burn test.
dataset/train/55_6.wav|And, of course, I'm curious to see if it breaks in half like the last two.
dataset/train/55_7.wav| Do it!
dataset/train/55_8.wav| Let's get started.
dataset/train/55_9.wav|This 12.9 inch M1 iPad Pro starts at $1,099.
dataset/train/55_10.wav|And unfortunately as we can see, it still has the microphone hole in the side. Might as well give it
dataset/train/55_11.wav|an RIP down in the comments. Rest in peace. Let's start with the screen. This thing is massive.
dataset/train/55_12.wav| That's what...
dataset/train/55_13.wav| Don't do it.
dataset/train/55_14.wav| Apple's calling this screen a liquid retina XDR Mini LED display. A mouth full of buzz words
dataset/train/55_15.wav|but basically it's just the next generation of LCD technology. It's still a screen with a backlight.
dataset/train/55_16.wav|I'll get into more detail about what's under the glass later in the video, but for now we can see
dataset/train/55_17.wav|from the Mohs scale of hardness that it still scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at
dataset/train/55_18.wav|a level 7; just like most cellphones. There is a 12 megapixel front facing camera at the top,
dataset/train/55_19.wav|which can do motion tracking on video calls or video chats. The sides of the M1 Pro are made from
dataset/train/55_20.wav|100% recycled aluminum, which is great. We still have the magnetic pencil dock
dataset/train/55_21.wav|right here at the weakest point in the frame. We'll see how that works
dataset/train/55_22.wav|out later. The 5G version will also have additional antennas built into the frame.
dataset/train/55_23.wav|And, of course, we still have the volume buttons up here at the top corner.
dataset/train/55_24.wav|The top of the iPad Pro has two of the four speakers,
dataset/train/55_25.wav|along with two more microphone holes and the power button. Then here on the left
dataset/train/55_26.wav|side we get that microphone hole that caused the demise of the last two iPads we tested.
dataset/train/55_27.wav|This time around the iPad Pro is half a millimeter thicker than the previous versions,
dataset/train/55_28.wav|so maybe Apple did add some more structure to the metal. We'll find out soon enough.
dataset/train/55_29.wav|The bottom has two more speakers along with a USB-C thunderbolt connector.
dataset/train/55_30.wav|Still no headphone jack, but I think people are used to that at this point.
dataset/train/55_31.wav|There are a few cameras on the back. The top one being the 10 megapixel ultra wide,
dataset/train/55_32.wav|and the bottom one being the regular 12 megapixel main sensor,
dataset/train/55_33.wav|with a dual LED flash built into the hump, and a lidar sensor for
dataset/train/55_34.wav|AR and auto focusing. There is a long antenna line running along the top and bottom, and you
dataset/train/55_35.wav|can hear the difference between the aluminum and the plastic that allows signals to pass through.
dataset/train/55_36.wav|For the rest of the back we have some good news and some bad news.
dataset/train/55_37.wav|Not too long ago, back in the 1970's, Africa had a population of about 1.3 million elephants.
dataset/train/55_38.wav|Nowadays, due to poaching and loss of habitat,
dataset/train/55_39.wav|the elephant population is less than a third of what it was back in the 70s.
dataset/train/55_40.wav|There are only about 400,000 left.
dataset/train/55_41.wav|Now, I'm not normally a 'save the elephants' type of guy, but yikes.
dataset/train/55_42.wav|The good news is that Kenya has really stepped up their game,
dataset/train/55_43.wav|and managed to double their own elephant population in the last 30 years.
dataset/train/55_44.wav|Nice work, Kenya. But that's just one country out of the 54 countries in Africa.
dataset/train/55_45.wav|I personally don't know how to fix it,
dataset/train/55_46.wav|but Apple is sitting on about 200 billion dollars of cash right now.
dataset/train/55_47.wav|Maybe they can think of some way to help out. That would be pretty cool.
dataset/train/55_48.wav|It is a tricky issue since elephants are pregnant for about two whole years.
dataset/train/55_49.wav|I think she turned out pretty good.
dataset/train/55_50.wav|Now let's talk about the screen for a second. This is where the iPad has noticeably improved
dataset/train/55_51.wav|since last year...But remember, only on the big one. Apple is calling this the Liquid Retina
dataset/train/55_52.wav|XDR Mini LED display, and this is our first time burning a mini LED. While it's very different than
dataset/train/55_53.wav|OLED technology, it's definitely taking the LCD style of back light to the next level. Apple has
dataset/train/55_54.wav|installed 10,000 mini LED's under the screen. Notice I didn't say pixels. There are about 5
dataset/train/55_55.wav|½ million pixels and those pixels are backlit by the 10,000 mini LEDs. So it still has a backlight.
dataset/train/55_56.wav|But those mini LEDs give way more brightness and control over the pixels in front of them,
dataset/train/55_57.wav|more so than a conventional LCD screen. OLED screens, on the other hand, like on the iPhones,
dataset/train/55_58.wav|had self-emissive pixels that don't need a backlight. By comparison, the iPad's mini
dataset/train/55_59.wav|LED screen has a fantastically awesome 1 million to 1 contrast ratio. But if we look at the OLED
dataset/train/55_60.wav|screens on the iPhones, it's an infinity to 1 contrast ratio since the blacks are perfect
dataset/train/55_61.wav|with zero light behind them. Both screens, of course, are great and get the job done, just
dataset/train/55_62.wav|different technologies. Personally, I see the mini LED screen, like the one this iPad is using, being
dataset/train/55_63.wav|more color accurate and good for work and editing, while the OLED screens are more vibrant and better
dataset/train/55_64.wav|for entertainment and movies. But that's just my personal preference. Either way, the mini LEDs
dataset/train/55_65.wav|are pretty fantastic and still acting like an LCD during the burn test – going black with the heat
dataset/train/55_66.wav|from my lighter in about 17 seconds and recovering after the heat is removed. The average person,
dataset/train/55_67.wav|of course, would have no idea there's even a difference between OLED and mini LED.
dataset/train/55_68.wav|There is no fingerprint scanner. Apple's relying on the face ID thing. So I guess it's time for
dataset/train/55_69.wav|the bend test. This is the largest device I've ever attempted to bend before. While
dataset/train/55_70.wav|it is indeed half a millimeter thicker, it still has the microphone hole and magnetic
dataset/train/55_71.wav|pencil mount in the weakest spots. It's time to find out what happens. Bending from the back,
dataset/train/55_72.wav|the screen bends and flexes out and away from the aluminum frame. I didn't know glass could do that.
dataset/train/55_73.wav|The adhesive on the screen even separates from the metal, but the iPad did not catastrophically
dataset/train/55_74.wav|snap in half like it did last time. Oh, it's bent for sure, but bent is better than broke.
dataset/train/55_75.wav|Everything still seems to be functioning just fine just around this newly installed bend.
dataset/train/55_76.wav|I still highly recommend not sitting on the tablet, of course. But it is good to know that the
dataset/train/55_77.wav|M1 iPad Pro can survive at least one round of the bend test. Bending from the screen side this time
dataset/train/55_78.wav|we get even less flex, probably because the glass has adjusted with the metal frame and doesn't
dataset/train/55_79.wav|give it much room to bend in this direction. It's starting to look like a crinkled piece of paper,
dataset/train/55_80.wav|but even after round 2 from the back, the 2021 larger M1 iPad Pro survives my durability test.
dataset/train/55_81.wav|It's definitely a sad little unit now, but still alive and kicking.
dataset/train/55_82.wav|Nice work, Apple. Thumbs up for that. I told dbrand that I would show off my new M1 Teardown
dataset/train/55_83.wav|Skins, but I kind of forgot to do it earlier in the video. Definitely would have been easier to
dataset/train/55_84.wav|apply the Teardown Skin back when the tablet was still straight. Like all problems, including our
dataset/train/55_85.wav|elephant issue, it's easier to do things before it gets too bad. I'll leave a link down below so you
dataset/train/55_86.wav|can grab a Teardown Skin for your own devices so you can see the insides from the outside.
dataset/train/55_87.wav|I'll be linking that right next to Tim Cook's Twitter. Maybe just ping him about the elephant
dataset/train/55_88.wav|thing. Actually, about an hour after I filmed this video and finished drawing my elephant,
dataset/train/55_89.wav|Tim Cook himself tweeted about how Apple is now supporting wildlife conservation in Kenya.
dataset/train/55_90.wav|And I don't know what Seri told him, but that is a creepy fast coincidence.
dataset/train/55_91.wav|Either way, 10 out of 10, our elephant friend approves.
dataset/train/55_92.wav|Any step is a great step in the right direction. Maybe we can ping him with a 'thank you' instead.
dataset/train/55_93.wav|As always, hit that subscribe button. I've got plenty of more videos on the way.
dataset/train/55_94.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/55_95.wav|That's what she...
dataset/train/55_96.wav| Stop it!
dataset/train/56_1.wav|So in front of us today we have something we've never seen before, a smartphone made
dataset/train/56_2.wav|completely out of carbon fiber. Carbon fiber is some impressive stuff. This is the Carbon
dataset/train/56_3.wav|1 Mark II from a company called Carbon Mobile. What makes Carbon fiber special is its ability
dataset/train/56_4.wav|to be incredibly strong, while at the same time being incredibly lightweight. Inside
dataset/train/56_5.wav|the box we have just the phone which is super thin, and a USB-C charging cable. You can
dataset/train/56_6.wav|see the carbon fiber weave all over the back and sides of the phone. Let's see how much
dataset/train/56_7.wav|this thing actually weighs. In front of me I have an electronic scale. I'll take the
dataset/train/56_8.wav|screen protector off so we can get the exact weight of the phone. And setting it one the
dataset/train/56_9.wav|scale we get 128 grams, which is pretty impressive considering that if you take my own phone
dataset/train/56_10.wav|and swap places, we are getting 243 grams. If we take my case off and weigh the phone
dataset/train/56_11.wav|without it, we get about 200 grams, which is still almost twice as much as the carbon
dataset/train/56_12.wav|fiber phone. A phone this lightweight and thin should make the durability test very
dataset/train/56_13.wav|interesting.
dataset/train/56_14.wav|Huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. Stamps.com is giving out 5 pound electronic
dataset/train/56_15.wav|scales similar to this one, with a four week free trial. Stamps.com is able to bring the
dataset/train/56_16.wav|services of the United States Postal Service and UPS right to your computer. So if you
dataset/train/56_17.wav|regularly send letters or packages for your business or side hustle, it's pretty easy
dataset/train/56_18.wav|to join up with the 1 million other small businesses using Stamps.com. It's also really
dataset/train/56_19.wav|nice to not stand in line at the post office, since you know, time is money. I ship a lot
dataset/train/56_20.wav|of stuff lately with all my knives and stickers, and it's nice to be able to do everything
dataset/train/56_21.wav|from my own computer, Stamps.com has discounts of up to 40% for the United States Postal
dataset/train/56_22.wav|Service, and up to 60% off of the UPS shipping rates. And you can just print the postage
dataset/train/56_23.wav|right from your own computer. To get those discounted shipping rates, your own free 5
dataset/train/56_24.wav|pound digital scale, and some free postage, just head to Stamps.com. And up in the corner
dataset/train/56_25.wav|of the website enter the word “jerryrig”. There are no long term commitments or contracts,
dataset/train/56_26.wav|so it's a win-win for everyone. I'll also put a link down in the video description.
dataset/train/56_27.wav|Now it's time to see if this super thin and lightweight carbon fiber cell phone can handle
dataset/train/56_28.wav|a durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/56_29.wav|This carbon fiber phone costs about $800. Carbon fiber is tricky to work with but can
dataset/train/56_30.wav|accomplish some pretty cool things. This Carbon 1 is about half as thick as my Note 10 Plus
dataset/train/56_31.wav|in a grip case, and like I mentioned earlier, also weighs about half as much. It might also
dataset/train/56_32.wav|be my imagination or overconfidence, but it definitely feels like I could snap it in half.
dataset/train/56_33.wav|But let's start with the scratch test.
dataset/train/56_34.wav|In order to get this phone so thin, there is no camera bump, which is nice. And Carbon
dataset/train/56_35.wav|Mobile is using a super thin slice of Gorilla Glass Victus for this screen, which as we
dataset/train/56_36.wav|know, and can see by moving up the Mohs scale of hardness, scratches at a level 6 with deeper
dataset/train/56_37.wav|grooves at a level 7. Up at the top of the phone, we get a 20 megapixel camera tucked
dataset/train/56_38.wav|into the upper bezel protected by glass. We have a v-shaped earpiece, which is plastic
dataset/train/56_39.wav|and securely attached to the display. It won't be falling out on its own. The bottom edge
dataset/train/56_40.wav|of the phone has a matching bezel, and it's not a big deal, the carbon fiber, however,
dataset/train/56_41.wav|is. So if you're curious as to what carbon fiber sounds like when it's scratched, it's
dataset/train/56_42.wav|kind of similar to plastic since the fiber strands are held together with an epoxy or
dataset/train/56_43.wav|resin. I'll talk more about that in a second. The fingerprint scanner can be scratched.
dataset/train/56_44.wav|Then we have a textured metal power button, along with the individual metal volume buttons.
dataset/train/56_45.wav|One downside of carbon fiber though is that it's an insulator, and like metal doesn't
dataset/train/56_46.wav|really allow for the pass through of radio signals. So Carbon Mobile has engineered some
dataset/train/56_47.wav|kind of special hybrid radio friendly composite material for the top and bottom ends of the
dataset/train/56_48.wav|phone, which is basically just plastic end caps, so it can make phone calls.
dataset/train/56_49.wav|The left side of the phone has more carbon fiber, along with the SIM card tray, which
dataset/train/56_50.wav|doubles as an SD card slot. The tray itself is metal, but there is no waterproofing rubber
dataset/train/56_51.wav|ring around the opening or any IP rating at all. The bottom has more signal friendly plastic
dataset/train/56_52.wav|around the loudspeaker, the USB-C charging port and the microphone hole. Also the phone
dataset/train/56_53.wav|just randomly turned off on me which isn't a good sign. There are two cameras on the
dataset/train/56_54.wav|back protected by glass. Both are 16 megapixels and both are the same focal length, no telephoto
dataset/train/56_55.wav|or wide angle. There is a dual colored LED flash.
dataset/train/56_56.wav|Now let's talk about carbon fiber for a second. Carbon fiber is lighter than steel or aluminum,
dataset/train/56_57.wav|with 2-5x more rigidity at the same thickness, depending on the fibers of course. That lightness
dataset/train/56_58.wav|and rigidity is why Formula 1 race cars are built mostly with carbon fiber frames and
dataset/train/56_59.wav|components. Even the drive shafts are made from carbon fiber. I've been following a YouTube
dataset/train/56_60.wav|channel for the past year or so called DarkAero. They are building an entire airplane out of
dataset/train/56_61.wav|carbon fiber. Super interesting to watch the carbon fiber cloth mix with the resin and
dataset/train/56_62.wav|turn into super strong compound curve designs. The strength of the carbon fiber comes from
dataset/train/56_63.wav|the direction that the fibers are oriented. Carbon fiber is great for two dimensional
dataset/train/56_64.wav|loads that align with the direction of the fibers, but once you add that third dimension
dataset/train/56_65.wav|of stress, like the stress that would come from a bend test, the carbon fiber is just
dataset/train/56_66.wav|not designed for that. It's also not designed for extreme heat, but here we are. My Carbon
dataset/train/56_67.wav|1 Mark II decided to just shut itself off again after about 2 seconds of flame. Hopefully
dataset/train/56_68.wav|it's just my unit that keeps power cycling. After about 20 seconds we get the phone back
dataset/train/56_69.wav|on again and we can see that the 6 inch AMOLED display does indeed have white burn marks
dataset/train/56_70.wav|and does not completely recover from the fire. Normally, I do prefer my fingerprint scanner
dataset/train/56_71.wav|to be incorporated to the power button, that way if it ever decides to not work, my finger
dataset/train/56_72.wav|is already in place to manually unlock the screen. These guys though decided to add the
dataset/train/56_73.wav|fingerprint scanner on the side, but as a separate unit not connected to the power button.
dataset/train/56_74.wav|And it also just doesn't really seem to be working all that well. I did lightly scratch
dataset/train/56_75.wav|it with my razor when we were analyzing the materials, and it's just currently toast.
dataset/train/56_76.wav|Most fingerprint scanners can survive quite a bit more abuse than this.
dataset/train/56_77.wav|Well, I think it's time we find out how structurally sound a carbon fiber smartphone really is
dataset/train/56_78.wav|since smartphones are some of the most accidentally abused pieces of technology on the planet.
dataset/train/56_79.wav|Sliding a Carbon 1 into your back pocket and sitting down with the screen curving along
dataset/train/56_80.wav|with your curves would leave the phone mostly fine. No cracks or permanent damage, just
dataset/train/56_81.wav|some pretty major flex. It's the bending from the other direction that we'll need to watch
dataset/train/56_82.wav|out for. Carbon fiber is not so strong around it's third axis perpendicular to those fibers.
dataset/train/56_83.wav|This phone is officially totaled and does not survive my durability test. To be fair,
dataset/train/56_84.wav|it looks like Carbon Mobile used the bare minimum amount of carbon fiber in the build
dataset/train/56_85.wav|to keep things super thin. If their fiber layering were thicker or more robust, it might
dataset/train/56_86.wav|have survived. Of course, if someone were to sit on this phone vertically, the carbon
dataset/train/56_87.wav|fiber frame would probably support far more than an aluminum phone of the same thickness
dataset/train/56_88.wav|since that is the direction the strands are oriented. But I do hope nobody is sitting
dataset/train/56_89.wav|on their phone vertically
dataset/train/56_90.wav|Since we're already halfway taken apart, I say we just keep going so we can check out
dataset/train/56_91.wav|the carbon fiber from the inside. The Carbon 1 has a monocock design, and no I did not
dataset/train/56_92.wav|make that word up. Monocock means that the carbon fiber portion is acting as a structural
dataset/train/56_93.wav|skin, like an exoskeleton or shell where the internal components are supported by that
dataset/train/56_94.wav|exterior frame. Some of the F1 racing cars are built this way and offer a lot of protection
dataset/train/56_95.wav|for the drivers. With all the screw out and the thin mid plate removed, along with the
dataset/train/56_96.wav|SIM card tray, we get a look at that interior portion of the carbon fiber shell. It's unpolished
dataset/train/56_97.wav|on the inside since this is the stuff people don't normally see...except for all of us
dataset/train/56_98.wav|right now, of course. It looks like the 16 megapixel lens on the left does have some
dataset/train/56_99.wav|kind of optical image stabilization, but the lens on the right does not. The battery is
dataset/train/56_100.wav|also here attached to the midlate. It has magical pull tabs which would be used of course
dataset/train/56_101.wav|if someone were dissembling this phone correctly. Just pulling the adhesive strip allows the
dataset/train/56_102.wav|battery to come free with zero bending or prying on the battery itself. Much safer.
dataset/train/56_103.wav|The battery does say it's a 2800 milliamp hour which is a little bit off from the 3,000
dataset/train/56_104.wav|milliamp hours advertised on Carbon Mobile's website.
dataset/train/56_105.wav|Finally, the carbon fiber frame. Two things call our attention: first of which is the
dataset/train/56_106.wav|little circles of plastic, probably used to join the top layer of plastic that the antennas
dataset/train/56_107.wav|can go through to the carbon fiber frame that the antennas can not send signals through.
dataset/train/56_108.wav|Also these cute little threaded inserts for holding the electronic components to the carbon.
dataset/train/56_109.wav|Metal is just better at the tiny tolerant stuff like screws and threads so it's natural
dataset/train/56_110.wav|that these little metal inserts would be embedded into the carbon fiber. We see this a lot with
dataset/train/56_111.wav|3D printing and plastic. In summary, carbon fiber works great for race cars and airplanes
dataset/train/56_112.wav|where the stress and impacts can be calculated, but with cellphones where damage is willy-nilly,
dataset/train/56_113.wav|and any type of abuse can happen at any time, the carbon fiber should either be thicker
dataset/train/56_114.wav|or there needs to be something in addition, like some kind of mid plate to provide that
dataset/train/56_115.wav|perpendicular third plane of stress relief that the carbon fiber isn't equipped for.
dataset/train/56_116.wav|I'm sure it's doable. I think a heavy duty phone that isn't thin, made of real carbon
dataset/train/56_117.wav|fiber would be pretty awesome. Either way, it's cool to see innovation in the smartphone
dataset/train/56_118.wav|space, even if it didn't survive.
dataset/train/56_119.wav|What do you think of carbon fiber? Let me know down in the comments. Hit that subscribe
dataset/train/56_120.wav|button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks
dataset/train/56_121.wav|a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/57_1.wav|Today in front of us we have a phone with what claims to be a sapphire screen. This
dataset/train/57_2.wav|is a Duraforce Ultra 5G. Sapphire screens are incredibly rare and incredible scratch
dataset/train/57_3.wav|resistant, with a hardness level right up there next to diamonds. So if it's true and
dataset/train/57_4.wav|this phone does indeed have a sapphire display, it means it's one of the most durable and
dataset/train/57_5.wav|protected phones right out of the box on the planet. It should be very interesting because
dataset/train/57_6.wav|protection is a good thing – both physically and online. Huge thanks to Bitdefender for
dataset/train/57_7.wav|sponsoring this video. Bitdefender is a cybersecurity leader, delivering best in class prevention,
dataset/train/57_8.wav|protection, and response solutions worldwide. Bitdefender offers protection and privacy
dataset/train/57_9.wav|without compromising your device's performance. For as little as $3.34 a month, you get ransomware

dataset/train/57_15.wav|Protection is a good thing, and it's always better to have it before you need it, so I'll
dataset/train/57_16.wav|leave that link down below.
dataset/train/57_17.wav|People who are a fan of protection are probably going to really love this sapphire covered
dataset/train/57_18.wav|phone, if it really is indeed covered by sapphire. There's only one way to find out for sure.
dataset/train/57_19.wav|Let's get started.
dataset/train/57_20.wav|The Duraforce Ultra 5G with a sapphire shield is made by Kyocera. Kyocera's one of the OG's
dataset/train/57_21.wav|making rugged phones for the last 20 years. We've only seen a few sapphire screen smartphones
dataset/train/57_22.wav|in the past, notably, the HTC U Ultra Sapphire Edition and Kyocera's older sibling, the Duraforce
dataset/train/57_23.wav|Pro 2 released back in 2018. And, of course, Apple has tried making a sapphire watch and
dataset/train/57_24.wav|sapphire camera lenses, but their sapphire is more of a marketing than reality situation.
dataset/train/57_25.wav|This Ultra is definitely a rugged beefy looking phone, with kind of a builtin protective armor,
dataset/train/57_26.wav|thicker than even my own smartphone inside of dbrand's grip case. It's a tank, which
dataset/train/57_27.wav|is what we would expect from a phone that wants to be the world's most durable. Kyocera
dataset/train/57_28.wav|claims that this is ultra rugged, which means that it's even more rugged than regular rugged,
dataset/train/57_29.wav|and a sapphire screen would definitely help take it to the next level.
dataset/train/57_30.wav|I have a set of Mohs picks which tell us where different materials fall on Mohs scale of
dataset/train/57_31.wav|hardness. Plastic, like Samsung's folding phones, would start scratching at a level
dataset/train/57_32.wav|2 or 3. Glass phones, like the majority of smartphones on the market these days, would
dataset/train/57_33.wav|scratch at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. When we get to level 6 and 7,
dataset/train/57_34.wav|however, we see no visible markings on the display of the Duraforce Ultra. It still looks
dataset/train/57_35.wav|like a brand new phone right out of the box. Incredibly impressive. It's only when we get
dataset/train/57_36.wav|to level 8 that we do start seeing scratches, with deeper grooves at a level 9...levels
dataset/train/57_37.wav|on the Mohs scale of hardness that would normally just destroy a display. The Duraforce Ultra
dataset/train/57_38.wav|5G is indeed made from sapphire crystal, and unscratchable to nearly everything except
dataset/train/57_39.wav|diamonds.
dataset/train/57_40.wav|Speaking of which, the Mohs scale of hardness isn't the only way to verify sapphire. Here
dataset/train/57_41.wav|we have a diamond selector tool that's able to tell the difference between crystals and
dataset/train/57_42.wav|noncrystals since they have different thermal properties. For example, my wife's wedding
dataset/train/57_43.wav|ring, which I'm borrowing for a minute, registers as a gemstone. And if we test the display
dataset/train/57_44.wav|of the Duraforce Ultra, it also registers as a gemstone. But when I go to test the display
dataset/train/57_45.wav|of my own smartphone, it does not register as a gemstone since it's just made with tempered
dataset/train/57_46.wav|glass and nothing special. Thumbs up for science. I'm definitely not recommending that you propose
dataset/train/57_47.wav|with a Duraforce Ultra, but scientifically it's pretty similar to a wedding ring. We'll
dataset/train/57_48.wav|talk more about sapphire in a minute. Also, don't let me lose my wife's ring or I'm going
dataset/train/57_49.wav|to be in big trouble.
dataset/train/57_50.wav|There is an 8 megapixel front facing camera tucked under the sapphire display, along with
dataset/train/57_51.wav|a plastic earpiece, and what looks like a large plastic speaker grill down near the
dataset/train/57_52.wav|bottom that is solidly attached to the phone. And, of course, we have some very thick textured
dataset/train/57_53.wav|plastic sides, and large rubber bumpers on each of the 4 corners. This thing is specifically
dataset/train/57_54.wav|designed to withstand 5 foot drops onto concrete. There is a plastic programmable button on
dataset/train/57_55.wav|the right side, along with a SIM card tray with expandable memory SD card slot. Then
dataset/train/57_56.wav|we have the scratchable power button which is a fingerprint scanner combo. And up top
dataset/train/57_57.wav|we have another bright orange programmable button. This is supposed to be used for emergency
dataset/train/57_58.wav|SOS calls, but can be set to do other things if you're not living your life on the edge.
dataset/train/57_59.wav|And here underneath this watertight flap we find our good buddy, the headphone jack. This
dataset/train/57_60.wav|phone has everything.
dataset/train/57_61.wav|Going down the left side we have volume buttons, as well as a push to talk walkie talkie button
dataset/train/57_62.wav|thing. Then finally, down here at the bottom of the phone underneath another watertight
dataset/train/57_63.wav|flap, we get the USB-C charging port. The Duraforce Ultra is IP68 water resistant and
dataset/train/57_64.wav|is one of the only manufacturers that I know of that includes water damage in it's 2 year
dataset/train/57_65.wav|warranty. Everyone else, like Apple and Samsung, would leave you hanging if your phone gets
dataset/train/57_66.wav|wet, but Kyocera is right there with you. Kyocera even has an underwater camera mode.
dataset/train/57_67.wav|It's like they're just begging you to get your phone wet.
dataset/train/57_68.wav|The gold contacts on the backside are for docking accessories. Then we have the dual
dataset/train/57_69.wav|flash, along with a Time of Flight depth camera used for auto focus. In the center we have
dataset/train/57_70.wav|the 16 megapixel wide angle camera. And on the right side we have the main 24 megapixel
dataset/train/57_71.wav|sensor, all covered by more sapphire. For reference, the lens coverings on my own camera
dataset/train/57_72.wav|is just made from glass. Kyocera has spared no expense. You'd have to have a pocket full
dataset/train/57_73.wav|of diamonds to scratch up the display or the camera lens. And if you do have a pocket full
dataset/train/57_74.wav|of diamonds, I'd want to know why you have a pocket full of diamonds.
dataset/train/57_75.wav|One of the reasons sapphire displays are so rare is because of how hard it is to create.
dataset/train/57_76.wav|Sapphire is grown in huge furnaces at over 2,000 degrees celsius for over 2 weeks, with
dataset/train/57_77.wav|constant helium gas running through the crucible. After it's cooked you get a cylinder called
dataset/train/57_78.wav|a boule, which can then be cut into rectangular blocks that are used for cell phone screens
dataset/train/57_79.wav|or watches. Instead of drawing it on plastic though, I could just show you. This is a super
dataset/train/57_80.wav|heavy pure sapphire brick cut from one of the basketball size boules. It's worth about
dataset/train/57_81.wav|$1,000, and obviously smartphone screens are quite a bit thinner than this, so it would
dataset/train/57_82.wav|still need to be cut into thin slices...like really expensive cheese that probably doesn't
dataset/train/57_83.wav|taste very good. And since sapphire is so hard and scratch resistant, the whole process
dataset/train/57_84.wav|is very expensive and very difficult, which is why most manufacturers haven't attempted
dataset/train/57_85.wav|it. And some manufacturers, like Apple, just make impure knockoffs.
dataset/train/57_86.wav|Cooking crystal at high temperature for weeks is pretty awesome science. Speaking of high
dataset/train/57_87.wav|temperatures, the Duraforce Ultra is using a 5.4 inch 1080p IPS liquid crystal display.
dataset/train/57_88.wav|The pixels start to go black and turn off after about 30 seconds under the heat from
dataset/train/57_89.wav|my lighter, but after the heat is removed they do come back to life and make a full
dataset/train/57_90.wav|recovery. Lastly, the fingerprint reader. It's right where I like it – on the power
dataset/train/57_91.wav|button. This phone is designed to be used with gloves, but of course, the scanner does
dataset/train/57_92.wav|need contact with a bare fingerprint in order to function. If the scanner is ever scratched
dataset/train/57_93.wav|up, which would be hard to do considering the phone's shape, it will stop working though.
dataset/train/57_94.wav|But that does feel a little nit picky since the rest of the phone can survive near everything...except
dataset/train/57_95.wav|maybe a trip through a blender made of diamonds. A bend test even feels unnecessary at this
dataset/train/57_96.wav|point since I'd have to drive it over with a tank to cause any real damage. But like
dataset/train/57_97.wav|we all could have guessed, there is no flex, kinks, cracks or damage of any kind to the
dataset/train/57_98.wav|phone when bent from the back or the front. I could probably just skip testing any more
dataset/train/57_99.wav|phones this year since this guy pretty much just won The Most Durable Phone of 2021 award.
dataset/train/57_100.wav|It's a pretty amazing device. Nice work, Kyocera. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come
dataset/train/57_101.wav|up with next. Do you want sapphire on your next phone? Let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/57_102.wav|I'm going to go give my wife back her ring cuz happy wife, happy life.
dataset/train/57_103.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/57_104.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/58_1.wav|I have a dream that at some point I'll be able to take apart a folding phone
dataset/train/58_2.wav|and put it back together again in one piece...but I have a feeling today isn't going to be that day.
dataset/train/58_3.wav|This Huawei Mate X2 folding phone survived my durability test, and today we're going to see
dataset/train/58_4.wav|how it works from the inside with a teardown. This video is sponsored by Raycon. Raycons are wireless
dataset/train/58_5.wav|earbuds that cost half the price of other premium brands. With their super small footprint, compact
dataset/train/58_6.wav|design and long battery life, I use wireless earbuds for working out or running outside. Now
dataset/train/58_7.wav|that warmer weather is here it's a lot easier to exercise when there's no wires to deal with. These
dataset/train/58_8.wav|Raycons have 6 hours of play time on their own, and 24 hours of total play time with that charging
dataset/train/58_9.wav|case. And the coolest thing is that Raycon is so confident in their earbuds they'll let you try it
dataset/train/58_10.wav|risk free for 45 days. To get your own pair just click on the link in the description, or head to
dataset/train/58_11.wav|buyraycon.com/jerryrigeverything for for 15% off your order. There are different colors
dataset/train/58_12.wav|to choose from, and huge thanks to Raycon for sponsoring this video and supporting the channel.
dataset/train/58_13.wav|Now, it's time to cross your fingers for the Mate X2's health and well-being
dataset/train/58_14.wav|because maybe, with a little luck, it'll survive. Let's get started.
dataset/train/58_15.wav|So during their launch event, Huawei said they had paired steel with carbon fiber for supports
dataset/train/58_16.wav|underneath the screen, which is something we've never seen before so this should be interesting.
dataset/train/58_17.wav|The problem is that 75% of this phone is covered with a screen, so we'll just start with the one
dataset/train/58_18.wav|non-screen slab of glass and remove that first. Pretty straightforward: heat, suction cup, and my
dataset/train/58_19.wav|razor blade get the job done. It's when we have to remove the screen portion that things start
dataset/train/58_20.wav|to get a bit sketchy. With the back panel off we get our first look at the quad camera setup,
dataset/train/58_21.wav|with the large battery taking up a good portion of the space.
dataset/train/58_22.wav|Now for the exterior front glass screen. I'm still going to use heat and my razor blade, but I am
dataset/train/58_23.wav|going to upgrade my suction cup. The correct way to do this would be with a large suction hot plate
dataset/train/58_24.wav|that can lift the screen off without any pry tools. Since the bezels are so thin,
dataset/train/58_25.wav|any accidental pokes to the side of the OLED panel as I'm digging underneath will kill the screen.
dataset/train/58_26.wav|And with only a millimeter of edge bezel to work with,
dataset/train/58_27.wav|I'll need to have Doctor Strange levels of surgical precision...which
dataset/train/58_28.wav|apparently I don't have. As you can clearly see from the white lines running down the screen,
dataset/train/58_29.wav|this outer display is toast. The inner display is still doing great, but with the outer screen not
dataset/train/58_30.wav|sensing my touch any longer, my dreams of having a working phone after this is over. A quick little
dataset/train/58_31.wav|moment of silence for our fallen friend. And now that we're done mourning take a look at this.
dataset/train/58_32.wav|The screen is totally see-through up here at the top. Normally this kind of translucent display is
dataset/train/58_33.wav|reserved for sensors or underscreen cameras. I wonder if there was a feature they had planned
dataset/train/58_34.wav|but changed their minds at some point after the screen had been finalized. The only thing
dataset/train/58_35.wav|under here is the loudspeaker which definitely does not require a translucent screen. Most of
dataset/train/58_36.wav|the phone hardware is on the thicker half on the left. Remember this phone is shaped like a wedge.
dataset/train/58_37.wav|Since we've already mourned the loss of this phone, let's have a little fun with
dataset/train/58_38.wav|the folding display. The curve, or crease of the Mate X2's flexible screen is a bit
dataset/train/58_39.wav|more gentle than the Samsung Fold 2, which is better for the longevity of the screen.
dataset/train/58_40.wav|Huawei has added some rubber bits to help keep the dust and rocks out, like we saw during my
dataset/train/58_41.wav|durability test. And if we start peeling off the top clear layer of screen on this $3,000 phone,
dataset/train/58_42.wav|we see that it's very securely glued to the material underneath. It's an extra layer of
dataset/train/58_43.wav|plastic that looks like a screen protector but isn't. There's a lot of extra residue, but the
dataset/train/58_44.wav|screen is still alive. We saw that Samsung added a bumper to the front of their inner display,
dataset/train/58_45.wav|and Huawei has done something similar with a molded plastic edge tied directly into the metal
dataset/train/58_46.wav|frame of the phone. Feels like a more permanent solution, and as you can see, as I work my way
dataset/train/58_47.wav|around that edge once again, all it takes is a little poke and our inner flexible pixels start
dataset/train/58_48.wav|to turn green and slowly flow down to the bottom of the phone. And then our pixels start getting
dataset/train/58_49.wav|raptured in little white streaks on their way up to cellphone heaven. With a little more digging,
dataset/train/58_50.wav|we have the top plastic screen protector layer,
dataset/train/58_51.wav|then the polarizer, then the actual pixels underneath. Flexible displays are pretty cool.
dataset/train/58_52.wav|There is no ultra thin glass on this one though.
dataset/train/58_53.wav|Here is a closeup look at all those layers now that the pixels are gone.
dataset/train/58_54.wav|And unlike Huawei promised, there is no carbon fiber, at least not that we can see,
dataset/train/58_55.wav|just the same similar metal panels on each half like we saw in the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2, along
dataset/train/58_56.wav|with the spine that's made up of the same metal fence-like slats that give structure to the crease
dataset/train/58_57.wav|as the screen folds. I'm not saying Huawei copied Samsung's design, but the screens are suspiciously
dataset/train/58_58.wav|similar from the inside. Maybe they're both just using the same supplier. Either way, the internals
dataset/train/58_59.wav|of the phone are totally different, with Huawei choosing the carrot stick wedge looking design,
dataset/train/58_60.wav|and scooching all the important bits over to the thicker left half of the phone.
dataset/train/58_61.wav|There are a total of 22 screws holding down the plastic brackets and motherboard components
dataset/train/58_62.wav|on this side. Once those are out I can start removing all of the tightly packed components,
dataset/train/58_63.wav|like this single battery that has two connections for the super fast charging. It comes out pretty
dataset/train/58_64.wav|easily with that pull tab. Thumbs up for that. It's rated at 4,400 milliamp hours.
dataset/train/58_65.wav|The charging port ribbon comes out next, and interestingly has the LED flash for the camera
dataset/train/58_66.wav|spliced into the same ribbon. Creative. Working our way deeper into the phone so we can get access
dataset/train/58_67.wav|to Huawei's hinge. We remove the motherboard which has all 4 of the rear cameras still attached - the
dataset/train/58_68.wav|top rectangular periscope camera and the other three that I can unclip like little Legos.
dataset/train/58_69.wav|We have the large main 50 megapixel sensor with OIS,
dataset/train/58_70.wav|along with the 16 megapixel ultrawide which does not have OIS. Then we have the
dataset/train/58_71.wav|3x telephoto which does have that optical image stabilization. The rectangular periscope camera,
dataset/train/58_72.wav|which is capable of 10x zoom, is 8 megapixel. It uses its super long shape to redirect the
dataset/train/58_73.wav|light onto the sensor that's perpendicular to the back panel of the phone. I'll show you.
dataset/train/58_74.wav|Once we get that sensor popped off the end, we can start to see how the light is redirected at a 90
dataset/train/58_75.wav|degree angle inside of the rectangle, just like a periscope. The sensor is super small compared
dataset/train/58_76.wav|to other sensors we've seen, but that longer lens gives it the 10x zoom effect. Kind of fun.
dataset/train/58_77.wav|The motherboard rests on a pile of thermal paste, which interestingly isn't just transferring heat
dataset/train/58_78.wav|to the frame. It's also right above a bunch of Swiss cheese style holes
dataset/train/58_79.wav|that I assume let some of the heat flow out through the large folding screen
dataset/train/58_80.wav|in the center of the phone. On the skinny side of the Mate X2 we have the dual loudspeakers
dataset/train/58_81.wav|at top and bottom, which actually take up quite a bit of space. And the little
dataset/train/58_82.wav|circular vibrator which hardly takes up any space. The bottom loudspeaker has 4 screws
dataset/train/58_83.wav|and a little speaker vent that's the same carrot shape to match the angle of the phone.
dataset/train/58_84.wav|No waterproofing built into the speaker, but it does have balls. The water screen is built
dataset/train/58_85.wav|into the frame though, it's got the water resistant mesh that sits over the speaker opening.
dataset/train/58_86.wav|Pretty standard these days even if the rest of the phone isn't water resistant.
dataset/train/58_87.wav|Now for the hinge. There are a few differences between Huawei's hinge and Samsung's hinge.
dataset/train/58_88.wav|Huawei did change up the homework a little bit with this part of the phone. Peeling off the black
dataset/train/58_89.wav|stickers over the hinge we see that actually quite a bit of dirt from my durability test made it
dataset/train/58_90.wav|inside of the phone. None of the large grains of sand or rocks, but it's definitely dirty in here.
dataset/train/58_91.wav|There's dirt coming in from both ends of the hinge. It's not as dust proof as we thought.
dataset/train/58_92.wav|Huawei's hinge is also not multi positional. It can sit at a 90 degree angle like a laptop
dataset/train/58_93.wav|for desktop viewing, but for the most part it wants to snap open and closed.
dataset/train/58_94.wav|Samsung's hinge pretty much holds whatever position you leave it in. I'll remove 12 more
dataset/train/58_95.wav|screws on this right side so we can pop the metal frame away from the hinge. We're up to about 43
dataset/train/58_96.wav|screws now for anyone keeping track at home. There are 2 ribbons connecting the two halves together.
dataset/train/58_97.wav|Kind of feel like an adult version of Sesame Street with how many things we're counting,
dataset/train/58_98.wav|and there's still not a whole lot to see from this vantage point.
dataset/train/58_99.wav|The hinge is still bending and even though it's dirty there are no grinding noises.
dataset/train/58_100.wav|I'll unscrew another 10 screws, pop off the two remaining extension ribbons,
dataset/train/58_101.wav|and finally my hinge is free with still not a whole lot to see. Seems like Huawei is using far
dataset/train/58_102.wav|less moving parts on their hinge than we saw on Samsung's Fold 2. It's also a lot less modular.
dataset/train/58_103.wav|With some forceful persuasion I can get the metal spine to come loose from the back of the hinge.
dataset/train/58_104.wav|It's very securely glued into place and almost eats half the phone off my desk.
dataset/train/58_105.wav|But we finally get to see a bit more of what's going on in here. The screws holding the spine
dataset/train/58_106.wav|together are not removable. Looking close we can see that they've been spot-welded to the frame
dataset/train/58_107.wav|so they'll never come loose during the phone's lifespan. With things welded shut, it does make it
dataset/train/58_108.wav|a bit harder to see what's going on, but it looks like there might be a spring in there, along with
dataset/train/58_109.wav|some metal straps that act like a snap bracelet of sorts. It gets the job done, of course, but I
dataset/train/58_110.wav|still think Samsung is on top of the folding hinge department, especially with its internal bristles,
dataset/train/58_111.wav|gearing, and multi position ability. Not to mention it's a thousand dollars cheaper.
dataset/train/58_112.wav|Huawei has improved a lot from the Mate X to the X2, but I think Samsung is still number 1 in
dataset/train/58_113.wav|the folding game for the moment. And hopefully, over time, they all become a whole lot cheaper.
dataset/train/58_114.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/58_115.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/59_1.wav|Small little video today on Apple's small little AirTags. Apparently,
dataset/train/59_2.wav|these tiny little pucks can help you find anything you might have lost like:
dataset/train/59_3.wav|keys, purses, pets...ambition. I have the 4 pack in front of me which costs about $100.
dataset/train/59_4.wav|And for that price you might want to just practice not losing your stuff a little bit harder.
dataset/train/59_5.wav|Or, you know, pay me $100 and I'll just come hold your keys. I'm mostly
dataset/train/59_6.wav|joking though since these kind of actually do some pretty cool things. Let's get started.
dataset/train/59_7.wav|Right out of the box they look pretty good. Simple white design,
dataset/train/59_8.wav|with a super shiny stainless steel metal plate, with the Apple logo right front and
dataset/train/59_9.wav|center. You might forget your keys, but you'll never forget who owns the world you live in.
dataset/train/59_10.wav|Of course this was designed by Apple in California. And assembled in China, and functions
dataset/train/59_11.wav|with Bluetooth low energy alongside the ultra wide band. We'll get to those more in a second.
dataset/train/59_12.wav|As you can see, the scratches made from my razor blade on the back of the AirTag is pretty visible.
dataset/train/59_13.wav|I think we should see what level it really starts scratching at.
dataset/train/59_14.wav|I'll grab my Mohs picks and start with the level 2 plastic tip pick,
dataset/train/59_15.wav|and as we can see, there are no markings except for the little scratch near the apple bite that
dataset/train/59_16.wav|must have happened during shipping, or from my own microfiber cleaning cloth.
dataset/train/59_17.wav|Moving up to a level 3 copper pick, we start to see scratches on the surface of the stainless
dataset/train/59_18.wav|steel. It's not so much that the stainless itself is soft, it's just the shiny finish
dataset/train/59_19.wav|is so pristine that it's easily susceptible to blemishes. And some of these abrasions probably
dataset/train/59_20.wav|came from the dust on my cleaning cloth...which is supposed to be clean. So basically just plan
dataset/train/59_21.wav|on this finish not being pristine for long. Not a big deal, of course. I'll talk more later in the
dataset/train/59_22.wav|video about how to hide the scratches. The metal plate is about the same size as a U.S. quarter.
dataset/train/59_23.wav|The back of the AirTag is rounded as well and made from white plastic...which
dataset/train/59_24.wav|does a better job of hiding the scratches. Getting inside the AirTag is easy enough. This
dataset/train/59_25.wav|might be the first user replaceable battery in an Apple product since,
dataset/train/59_26.wav|well, ever. Thumbs up for that. With a little twist we reveal the Panasonic 3 volt CR2032,
dataset/train/59_27.wav|and this battery could supposedly last for about a year before needing to be switched out. The rest
dataset/train/59_28.wav|of the housing is slightly more difficult to get inside of. This thing is IP67 water resistant,
dataset/train/59_29.wav|so keeping track of your goldfish is an option. Finding Nemo would have been a much shorter
dataset/train/59_30.wav|video if his dad had one of these bad boys. With the inner plastics off, we get our first
dataset/train/59_31.wav|look at what seems to be another battery, but it's actually a small speaker for the tones that play
dataset/train/59_32.wav|when you're trying to find whatever it is that you're trying to find. It's a real easy way to
dataset/train/59_33.wav|cheat at hide and seek by the way. Just put one of these on your kid. It'll be a new game
dataset/train/59_34.wav|called Bill Gates and the Microchip...except for it's actually Tim Cook and an AirTag.
dataset/train/59_35.wav|The main board is actually pretty hard to remove with it being glued in place and all.
dataset/train/59_36.wav|But eventually we can get it separated from the plastic housing...while
dataset/train/59_37.wav|accidentally ripping both copper speaker wires in the process.
dataset/train/59_38.wav|Apple could have totally done some Iron Man level Easter eggs in here with the Apple Campus.
dataset/train/59_39.wav|But besides them both being circles, that's about all the similarities we get. Here's the magnetic
dataset/train/59_40.wav|portion of the speaker, and you can see the copper coils that drive the speaker right below it.
dataset/train/59_41.wav|The circuit board is pretty nifty. This is what contains the Bluetooth chip and the ultra wide
dataset/train/59_42.wav|band. The difference between the two, while both pretty similar, is that the ultra wide band's
dataset/train/59_43.wav|signal is easier to measure precise locations with than it is with Bluetooth signal alone.
dataset/train/59_44.wav|Your iPhone will measure the time it takes for the Ultra wide signal to pass from the AirTag to the
dataset/train/59_45.wav|phone, and that signal strength measurement is how it can pinpoint the exact location of the AirTag.
dataset/train/59_46.wav|The last thing inside of the AirTag is the NFC coil on the back of the black plastics.
dataset/train/59_47.wav|So even if you are further than say, 30 feet or 10 meters from your lost goldfish, Apple's network of
dataset/train/59_48.wav|phones and computers acts like a giant skynet...I mean, acts like a giant net that can help you find
dataset/train/59_49.wav|your missing item. Even Android phones can jump in on the action and scan this NFC to
dataset/train/59_50.wav|see who the AirTag belongs to, if you've allowed that feature. It's kind of like a luggage tag,
dataset/train/59_51.wav|but with extra steps. And then you might even get your lost item back, assuming, of course, that the
dataset/train/59_52.wav|other person is a decent human. But judging by the people who can't be bothered to wear a mask
dataset/train/59_53.wav|during the pandemic, you got a 50/50 chance. And I might be a little biased, but the easiest and
dataset/train/59_54.wav|coolest way to hide the scratches on the AirTags is with one of my Teardown Skins from dbrand.
dataset/train/59_55.wav|It's probably our easiest Skin to apply yet, and lets you see all the cool insides of the AirTag
dataset/train/59_56.wav|from the outsides. Instead of the AirTag looking like a white button from your grandma's fur coat,
dataset/train/59_57.wav|it's now a fine tuned location tracker fit for a sci-fi nerd. I'll leave a link down
dataset/train/59_58.wav|in the description. We probably have a Teardown Skin for your phone as well.
dataset/train/59_59.wav|Would you ever buy a $30 location tracker for your keys?
dataset/train/59_60.wav|I'm curious. Let me know down in the comments. Come hang out with
dataset/train/59_61.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/6_1.wav|There has been a lot of talk about sapphire lately – specifically around watches. This Apple watch
dataset/train/6_2.wav|Ultra is supposed to be sapphire. This Galaxy watch 5 is supposed to be sapphire. And this
dataset/train/6_3.wav|Garmin Fenix 7 is supposed to have sapphire, along with some solar panels. I'm pretty
dataset/train/6_4.wav|excited about this one. Sapphire is an extremely premium and very valuable man-made material,
dataset/train/6_5.wav|with a hardness level up near diamonds. To make sapphire, ingredients are subject to extreme
dataset/train/6_6.wav|heat for weeks to create a large block called a bool, which is then cut up or cored and sliced
dataset/train/6_7.wav|to make watch faces or cell phone screens. It's a super interesting process. As you probably know,
dataset/train/6_8.wav|we see smart phone screens scratching at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/6_9.wav|But sapphire...sapphire scratches at a level 8 or 9. It's exponentially harder than glass on
dataset/train/6_10.wav|the Mohs scale of hardness. We've seen sapphire used quite a bit with the TSO watches that we've
dataset/train/6_11.wav|tested in the past, as well as on the displays of Kyocera's lineup of ultra rugged smartphones.
dataset/train/6_12.wav|Apple however, ever since the iPhone 5, has claimed that they're using sapphire. And
dataset/train/6_13.wav|while it is technically true, it's a subpar grade of sapphire that still gets marked up
dataset/train/6_14.wav|at a level 6. Apple even used their impure sapphire on the $1300 Apple watch series 3,
dataset/train/6_15.wav|so I have some major doubts about the quality of sapphire here on the Apple watch Ultra.
dataset/train/6_16.wav|Which is kind of embarrassing. If other companies can get their hands on the real stuff, Apple,
dataset/train/6_17.wav|as one of the most valuable companies in the world, should be able to as well. So today we're
dataset/train/6_18.wav|going to see how well that “sapphire” on the Apple watch Ultra holds up and compare it to Samsung
dataset/train/6_19.wav|sapphire and Garmin sapphire. And hopefully, fingers crossed, everyone's sapphire is legit.
dataset/train/6_20.wav|And speaking of protecting, huge thanks to Rhinoshield for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/6_21.wav|Rhinoshield is known for creating durable and customizable phone cases and accessories.
dataset/train/6_22.wav|You can bling out a personalized one-of-a-kind case of your own, or pick from a plethora of
dataset/train/6_23.wav|other unique designs. From NASA, the NBA, PewDiePie, or you know, you can just keep it
dataset/train/6_24.wav|simple with some solid color, magsafe, friendly cases, which all come with lifetime warranties.
dataset/train/6_25.wav|Personally I'm a big fan of the 100% recycled paper packaging. Rhinoshield is having their
dataset/train/6_26.wav|biggest sale of the year with all products up to 60% off. And you can take an additional 10%
dataset/train/6_27.wav|off of that using code “jerryrig” with the link down in the description. Whether you
dataset/train/6_28.wav|need a more solid handle on your device, with a pop-out grip max or grip mini,
dataset/train/6_29.wav|or you just want 360 degree protection for your own phone, or as a gift for someone else,
dataset/train/6_30.wav|the link is down in the description. Unfortunately Rhinoshield did not send me any cases from their
dataset/train/6_31.wav|NASA collection. But if you need a case you should definitely scroll through those because there are
dataset/train/6_32.wav|some real winners. Huge thanks to Rhinoshield for sponsoring this video. And now it's time to
dataset/train/6_33.wav|see if all of these companies are telling the truth about their sapphire. Let's get started.
dataset/train/6_34.wav|In our journey today to find out if Apple, Samsung, and Garmin are using real sapphire,
dataset/train/6_35.wav|we have a few tools, the first of which is our diamond selector tool which tests the thermal
dataset/train/6_36.wav|conductivity of gemstones to see if they are real or not. Diamonds and sapphire are 5x more
dataset/train/6_37.wav|thermally conductive than copper. Can you imagine a sapphire frying pan? It might cost a million
dataset/train/6_38.wav|bucks, but it would cook your eggs so fast. The thermal conductivity means that the glass
dataset/train/6_39.wav|lens of the Pixel 7 Pro will not register on our tool, but the sapphire camera lens of the iPhone
dataset/train/6_40.wav|14 will. My wife's cubic zirconia ring won't thermally register, but her real diamond will.
dataset/train/6_41.wav|The glass Fossil won't register. But the extra hard and premium sapphire crystal Tiso watch face
dataset/train/6_42.wav|will. And, of course, if we take our massive block of sapphire which has not been cored out yet,
dataset/train/6_43.wav|it also registers as a gemstone. Maybe we should add a loop and turn this into an earring.
dataset/train/6_44.wav|The second method we'll use to verify gemstone status is with the Mohs scale of hardness. Plastic
dataset/train/6_45.wav|would scratch at a 2 or 3, glass at a 5 or 6, and sapphire would be a level 8 or 9...just shy of a
dataset/train/6_46.wav|level 10 diamond. Sapphire is extremely scratch resistant. I've been testing sapphire for a while
dataset/train/6_47.wav|now and Apple's sapphire has consistently had marks below a level 8 which doesn't really jive
dataset/train/6_48.wav|with where the crystal is supposed to fall, but we'll see where today takes us. Starting with
dataset/train/6_49.wav|the cheapest of our three watches, the Samsung Galaxy watch 5 at right around $300. That's a
dataset/train/6_50.wav|pretty cheap price point for something as premium as sapphire, but we'll see what happens. This is
dataset/train/6_51.wav|the 44 millimeter aluminum bodied watch which obviously has fitness and sleep tracking. And if
dataset/train/6_52.wav|we flip it over we have the heart rate sensors and a water resistance of five atmospheres,
dataset/train/6_53.wav|which is right around 50 meters. And, of course, some sapphire crystal branding on the back. The
dataset/train/6_54.wav|correct verbage for sapphire is always going to be sapphire crystal since the only attribute
dataset/train/6_55.wav|sapphire shares with glass is that they are both clear. The ingredients, atomic structure,
dataset/train/6_56.wav|and thermal conductivity are all very different. And lucky for Samsung, the Galaxy watch 5 indeed
dataset/train/6_57.wav|is sapphire. It doesn't ping quite as high as the Tiso but still registers. We'll head over
dataset/train/6_58.wav|to the scratch test to validate our findings since two tests are always better than one.
dataset/train/6_59.wav|We can see that the level 5 does not leave a mark. However, with level 6 I can feel and hear the tip
dataset/train/6_60.wav|of the pick start to catch on the surface of the sapphire. This could be an impurity thing, or it
dataset/train/6_61.wav|could also be the polish or texture of the watch face that's catching. The Mohs scale of hardness
dataset/train/6_62.wav|is a qualitative scale that ranks minerals and is not necessarily used to generate precise
dataset/train/6_63.wav|comparisons between the different minerals on the same level. So while I do feel the pick catching,
dataset/train/6_64.wav|I don't visibly see any damage to the sapphire. I can also feel the level 7 pick catch, but we don't
dataset/train/6_65.wav|see any real damage until level 8. Nice work, Samsung. The Galaxy watch 5 is using sapphire.
dataset/train/6_66.wav|Let's move over to the most expensive watch on the table, and the one I'm looking forward
dataset/train/6_67.wav|to the most – the Garmin Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar, which currently sits at around $900.
dataset/train/6_68.wav|Now online this is advertised as having titanium, but it's far too light in person to
dataset/train/6_69.wav|be made entirely from metal. The only titanium here is on the blue cap around the watch face.
dataset/train/6_70.wav|Everything white is made from plastic, which is fine, just different than I was anticipating. It's
dataset/train/6_71.wav|a very lightweight watch. The display is also very different from the Samsung. Instead of an AMOLED
dataset/train/6_72.wav|screen, the Garmin is using a transflective memory and pixel display, which is like a one
dataset/train/6_73.wav|bit per pixel LCD with basically a zero refresh rate. It's what allows us to get 22 days worth of
dataset/train/6_74.wav|battery life with the solar panels in the display instead of just 50 hours like we see on the
dataset/train/6_75.wav|Samsung. But that extra long battery life comes with an astronomical sacrifice in brightness.
dataset/train/6_76.wav|On the back it has more titanium with a water resistance rating of 100 meters – twice as
dataset/train/6_77.wav|much as the Samsung. But, you know, if I ever find myself 100 meters under water,
dataset/train/6_78.wav|something's really wrong. Good to know that my watch will still work though. Also on
dataset/train/6_79.wav|the back we have the power sapphire branding which, of course, is the reason we're here.
dataset/train/6_80.wav|Pulling out the diamond tester tool.
dataset/train/6_81.wav|Remember, the lights are not an indicator of purity, just thermal conductivity. But the
dataset/train/6_82.wav|readings of the Garmin are off the charts when compared to the Samsung watch. Working our way
dataset/train/6_83.wav|up through the secondary verification, Mohs scale of hardness, picks 6 and 7 both feel
dataset/train/6_84.wav|and sound smoother on Garmin sapphire. And then level 8 is again where we start seeing
dataset/train/6_85.wav|major damage to the crystal. The Garmin Fenix 7 is using real sapphire. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/6_86.wav|Came outside to check the solar intensity on the watch. And if we go right here we can
dataset/train/6_87.wav|see that it is indeed finding the sun and charging the batteries. And it keeps track
dataset/train/6_88.wav|of the solar illumination throughout the day which is pretty interesting.
dataset/train/6_89.wav|Now for the Apple watch. This guy is a tad cheaper than the Garmin, sitting at around
dataset/train/6_90.wav|$800. A major downside to the Apple watch is that it requires an iPhone to set up,
dataset/train/6_91.wav|which definitely limits who can use it. This is unfortunate since the Apple watch Ultra is
dataset/train/6_92.wav|probably the most feature rich wearable on the planet, and probably the best piece of hardware
dataset/train/6_93.wav|that Apple has ever made. But I shouldn't have to downgrade my cellphone to upgrade my watch. It's a
dataset/train/6_94.wav|shame it's locked into their ecosystem. The Apple watch Ultra is heavy and solid out of the box,
dataset/train/6_95.wav|having a full titanium body. Luckily my iPhone 14 still functions enough after the durability
dataset/train/6_96.wav|test to get the Ultra up and running. If this wasn't locked to an iPhone, I would probably
dataset/train/6_97.wav|totally be rocking it. It does have a retina LCD display which brings our battery life to 36 hours
dataset/train/6_98.wav|instead of 22 days like the Garmin watch. But we do get all that brightness back which is pretty
dataset/train/6_99.wav|nice. On the back of the watch we get all the heart rate sensor stuff, as well as another 100
dataset/train/6_100.wav|meter depth rating and some more sapphire crystal branding, which is what we're here to check on.
dataset/train/6_101.wav|The improved watch band looks very secure. One time my buddy Dan was cliff jumping
dataset/train/6_102.wav|into a lake and lost his Apple watch for 9 months under water. We eventually found it
dataset/train/6_103.wav|and I fixed it. You should definitely check out that video if you haven't already. But yeah,
dataset/train/6_104.wav|this new watch band is definitely more secure than the previous versions. It's also 
dataset/train/6_105.wav|real sapphire. Three for three. Of course we can double check with our Mohs scale
dataset/train/6_106.wav|of hardness. Level 5 slides smoothly over the surface. But again, similar to the Galaxy watch,
dataset/train/6_107.wav|the level 6 pick starts gripping which you can audibly hear. There are some markings where
dataset/train/6_108.wav|the pick was moving on the surface. And you can again hear the grip of the level 7 pick,
dataset/train/6_109.wav|and these markings are a tad more visible. And, of course, our level 8 pick is where the real damage
dataset/train/6_110.wav|begins. So it does look like Apple is still using the same sapphire that they've always been using.
dataset/train/6_111.wav|Samsung might have the same supplier. Or it could be a polishing issue, but out of the three, the
dataset/train/6_112.wav|Garmin sapphire feels to me most like the Tiso and like it'll hold up the best. Either way though,
dataset/train/6_113.wav|it's incredibly cool to see all three watches using such a premium material. A synthesized,
dataset/train/6_114.wav|man-made, technological marvel, making its way onto the technology we use everyday. The
dataset/train/6_115.wav|average person, of course, wouldn't be able to visually tell the difference between glass and
dataset/train/6_116.wav|sapphire. But since you're here watching my videos, you're already far superior to the
dataset/train/6_117.wav|average person, and we've now scientifically confirmed sapphire's existence on each watch.
dataset/train/6_118.wav|Make sure your above average self hits that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come
dataset/train/6_119.wav|hang out with me on Instagram. I'd say Twitter as well, but that's like offering a free seat on the
dataset/train/6_120.wav|Hindenburg. And by “free” I meant 8 dollars. Don't forget about the massive discounts from
dataset/train/6_121.wav|Rhinoshield using the link in the description. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/60_1.wav|The Huawei Mate X2. You probably thought that folding phones were going to take a
dataset/train/60_2.wav|break during the pandemic...or maybe you didn't think about folding phones at all.
dataset/train/60_3.wav|Could kind of go either way with this one. Huawei just released the second version of their
dataset/train/60_4.wav|folding smartphone. This time around the large screen is on the inside instead of the outside.
dataset/train/60_5.wav|Inside the box we get a nifty little half case that matches the color of the phone,
dataset/train/60_6.wav|as well as a powerfully fast 66 watt charging brick and some corded USB-C headphones.
dataset/train/60_7.wav|At just shy of $3,000, it costs about $1,000 more than Samsung's folding smartphone. But you
dataset/train/60_8.wav|do get this sweet little kick stand, which might just be worth $1,000 to some people. Everybody's
dataset/train/60_9.wav|different. It's time for a durability test. This video is sponsored by Audible. Let's get started.
dataset/train/60_10.wav|As I'm starting up the phone we get this list full of good ideas for my durability test,
dataset/train/60_11.wav|like “do not press on the screen with hard or sharp objects.”
dataset/train/60_12.wav|And this one down here: “don't expose your phone to sand.” I'm sure these are good warnings for
dataset/train/60_13.wav|the average person who wants their phone to last, but we're here to find out if the phone can last.
dataset/train/60_14.wav|Weirdly enough this thing is shaped like a carrot. I wasn't expecting that.
dataset/train/60_15.wav|Apparently it's supposed to help with the weight and balance or something when using it one-handed.
dataset/train/60_16.wav|There are also some carbon fiber supports inside that we'll have to look for during the teardown.
dataset/train/60_17.wav|Closed up and folded shut, it's just a tad smaller than my almost 2 year old Note 10 Plus.
dataset/train/60_18.wav|And just about the same thickness as my phone inside of it's Teardown grip case from dbrand.
dataset/train/60_19.wav|It's interesting that the entire X2 is basically the same size as my phone in a case,
dataset/train/60_20.wav|yet has 3x the screen real estate. The folding action itself feels a bit easier to maneuver
dataset/train/60_21.wav|than the Fold 2, as well as the crease in the center seems to be a bit more gentle,
dataset/train/60_22.wav|not as sharp. I'd compare the two if my Fold 2 was still alive, but it's not.
dataset/train/60_23.wav|Speaking of dying, it's time for the scratch test. Huawei has given us a
dataset/train/60_24.wav|removable plastic screen protector on the front display. Very nice of them. We know
dataset/train/60_25.wav|that with the Mohs scratch test a plastic screen will start scratching a level 2 or 3,
dataset/train/60_26.wav|a glass screen will scratch at a 5 or 6.
dataset/train/60_27.wav|And a sapphire screen would scratch at level 8 or 9. And as we can see from the scratches at a level
dataset/train/60_28.wav|6, with deeper grooves at a level 7, this front display on the X2 is made from tempered glass.
dataset/train/60_29.wav|It can use glass on the surface since it's not doing any bending.
dataset/train/60_30.wav|The larger inner display, however, is doing a lot of bending and we start seeing marks at level 2,
dataset/train/60_31.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 3 since it's so soft. My level 3 pick is pretty much
dataset/train/60_32.wav|just cutting into the plastic, and it's also pretty much just what we were expecting,
dataset/train/60_33.wav|with, once again, my fingernail being able to leave marks on the surface of this inner screen.
dataset/train/60_34.wav|Folding phones are super cool, of course, they just need a little more tender loving care than
dataset/train/60_35.wav|your average smartphone, and I don't see that changing much in the near future. For this inner
dataset/train/60_36.wav|screen at least. The outer screen is pretty much business as usual with the glass protecting its
dataset/train/60_37.wav|16 megapixel front facing camera. There's also a plastic earpiece grill up here, and the sides of
dataset/train/60_38.wav|the X2 are made from metal. The power button is scratchable, along with the metal volume rocker.
dataset/train/60_39.wav|It's kind of cool we can test both the left and right sides of the phone at the exact same time.
dataset/train/60_40.wav|The top of the phone has one of those dual loudspeaker grills,
dataset/train/60_41.wav|as well as a SIM card tray which has a proprietary nano memory card slot built in.
dataset/train/60_42.wav|The metal spine of the phone has no branding which is kind of refreshing.
dataset/train/60_43.wav|And then we have the back glass with a super large camera bump up in the top left corner.
dataset/train/60_44.wav|And finally, the bottom of the phone has it's USB-C port and the second stereo loudspeaker. I
dataset/train/60_45.wav|do like that this X2 has more of a teardrop shaped cavity for the screen to fold into.
dataset/train/60_46.wav|The sharper and more abrupt the crease, the more likely it is that the plastic and pixels
dataset/train/60_47.wav|are to fatigue and crack over time. So this softer curve should help the X2 last longer.
dataset/train/60_48.wav|The hinge also wants to be closed or opened all the way.
dataset/train/60_49.wav|It's not multi positional like the Galaxy Fold is, which is something to consider.
dataset/train/60_50.wav|There are plenty of cameras though. This big boy up here is a 10x optical zoom periscope camera.
dataset/train/60_51.wav|Then we have the 50 megapixel main sensor, a 16 megapixel ultrawide, and a 3x optical zoom down
dataset/train/60_52.wav|at the bottom, with the dual colored LED flash, all sitting inside the rather large camera bump.
dataset/train/60_53.wav|One thing that's rather hard to avoid here on earth though is earth itself. You're kind of going
dataset/train/60_54.wav|to find earth wherever you go. So finding out how dustproof this hinge really is is definitely worth
dataset/train/60_55.wav|our time. With how many gears and precision engineering components inside of the hinge,
dataset/train/60_56.wav|one grain of sand could really mess things up. We'll make sure that the dust is sufficiently
dataset/train/60_57.wav|jiggled up and shaken around. It's interesting that the diagonal seam of the X2 is so tight
dataset/train/60_58.wav|that it's not letting the dust escape, which means it would probably do a decent job of keeping the
dataset/train/60_59.wav|dust from entering as well...hopefully. Otherwise it would turn into a $3,000 Etch-a-Sketch.
dataset/train/60_60.wav|Even with this forayed into a sandpit though, the hinge has stayed pretty clean
dataset/train/60_61.wav|and smooth, without any discernible noise difference or grinding gears.
dataset/train/60_62.wav|Nice work, Huawei. There is dust resistance.
dataset/train/60_63.wav|Let's turn up the heat a little. From what I've seen, people are in 3 tribes concerning
dataset/train/60_64.wav|folding phones. Some people are all about them. Some people hate them. And some people couldn't
dataset/train/60_65.wav|care less. Personally, I think I'd be using one if the price point was in the same ballpark as
dataset/train/60_66.wav|the average flagship, which right now it's not. The 6.4 inch 90 hertz front display
dataset/train/60_67.wav|lasted about 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter before going white and not recovering.
dataset/train/60_68.wav|Humans have been dividing themselves up into opinionated tribes since the dawn of time.
dataset/train/60_69.wav|I recently finished an audiobook from Audible called AC/DC by Tom McNichol. The savage tale
dataset/train/60_70.wav|of the first standards war, where he very interestingly explains how brutal the alternating
dataset/train/60_71.wav|current and direct current debates were back in the late 1800s when humans were learning to
dataset/train/60_72.wav|harness electricity. Tesla, Westinghouse, and Edison pretty much shaped the course of global
dataset/train/60_73.wav|history, and it got pretty intense. They even electrocuted an elephant just to prove a point.
dataset/train/60_74.wav|Things were pretty weird back then. You can listen to this audiobook yourself with a free
dataset/train/60_75.wav|30 day trial of Audible at audible.com/jerryrig. Or by texting the word “jerryrig” to 500-500.
dataset/train/60_76.wav|Every month you'll get one free audiobook and full access to the Audible Plus catalog,
dataset/train/60_77.wav|which has podcasts, fitness and meditation programs,
dataset/train/60_78.wav|and all kinds of Audible Originals. But for real, AC/DC is a really good listen, and it shows that
dataset/train/60_79.wav|fiery tribal like opinions have been around for a really long time. Audible.com/jerryrig.
dataset/train/60_80.wav|Or text “jerryrig” to 500-500. And huge thanks to Audible for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/60_81.wav|As you can see, the inner screen doesn't last near as long under the flame. Without the glass to
dataset/train/60_82.wav|dissipate the heat, the plastic covered pixels go black and permanently die after about 10 seconds.
dataset/train/60_83.wav|The inner screen is just more fragile than the exterior screens.
dataset/train/60_84.wav|Finally, the bend test. The X2 is a pretty beefy boy when the phone is closed,
dataset/train/60_85.wav|so there's no surprise that there's no flex from either side.
dataset/train/60_86.wav|And then, of course, we have the open and closing motion between the two halves, which means we're
dataset/train/60_87.wav|done. The phone does bend. There's no need to test anything else, right? It definitely folds.
dataset/train/60_88.wav|Thanks a ton for watching...Oh, you want to see it bent the other direction? I guess that
dataset/train/60_89.wav|can be arranged. The hinge still feels good and solid, even after our dust adventures.
dataset/train/60_90.wav|But I personally don't have high hopes for this thin carrot stick looking tablet
dataset/train/60_91.wav|to survive the bend test the wrong direction. But when bent from the back,
dataset/train/60_92.wav|the two halves meet in the center with the hinge giving some pretty solid internal structure.
dataset/train/60_93.wav|And the Mate X2 is unable to fold in the wrong direction, which is pretty
dataset/train/60_94.wav|impressive considering we've already had two non-folding gaming phones fold in half this year.
dataset/train/60_95.wav|At this point, a folding phone is more durable than a gaming phone, minus the soft inner screen
dataset/train/60_96.wav|part. My current phone is about 2 years old at the moment and still going strong.
dataset/train/60_97.wav|So I think I'll keep it for another year or two, but after that I'll most definitely consider a
dataset/train/60_98.wav|folding phone as my daily driver...especially with how far we've come in the past two years.
dataset/train/60_99.wav|It'll be cool to see where we end up in the next few...assuming we can all work
dataset/train/60_100.wav|together long enough to end the pandemic of course. Either way, nice work Huawei.
dataset/train/60_101.wav|Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the teardown. And come hang out
dataset/train/60_102.wav|with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching, and I'll see you around.
dataset/train/61_1.wav|It's time to take apart the $500 Black Shark 4 gaming smartphone.
dataset/train/61_2.wav|It'll be interesting to see if they kept their iconic metal X design underneath the plastic
dataset/train/61_3.wav|back since they ditched it on the outside.
dataset/train/61_4.wav|It'll also be cool to see how these mechanical buttons are able to magically pop up and down...since,
dataset/train/61_5.wav|you know, it wouldn't be a gaming phone without more triggers.
dataset/train/61_6.wav|Word on the street is they are using magnets.
dataset/train/61_7.wav|Let's get started.
dataset/train/61_8.wav|It's kind of nice working on a plastic phone.
dataset/train/61_9.wav|There's a whole lot less to worry about as I'm removing the back panel.
dataset/train/61_10.wav|I still need heat to soften up the adhesive of course, but I can be a little more aggressive
dataset/train/61_11.wav|with my razor without glass getting shattered.
dataset/train/61_12.wav|So far no big metal X frame inside.
dataset/train/61_13.wav|So it looks like Black Shark is stepping away from that design after 3 years.
dataset/train/61_14.wav|It probably saves quite a bit on manufacturing costs since the Black Shark 3 was one of the
dataset/train/61_15.wav|most complicated phones internally of all time.
dataset/train/61_16.wav|I'll unscrew the plastics over the top magnetic trigger buttons, and surprisingly they still
dataset/train/61_17.wav|work, even with the phone being off.
dataset/train/61_18.wav|Magnets are crazy.
dataset/train/61_19.wav|We'll dive deeper into the triggers in just a second.
dataset/train/61_20.wav|First I'll remove the 6 screws holding down the bottom plastics.
dataset/train/61_21.wav|Then I can remove the bottom loudspeaker, which does not have any balls, but does have
dataset/train/61_22.wav|the water resistant mesh over the opening.
dataset/train/61_23.wav|Even though the Black Shark 4 doesn't have an official IP water resistance rating, I'm
dataset/train/61_24.wav|not sure how you can be named after a fish without an official IP rating, but here we
dataset/train/61_25.wav|are.
dataset/train/61_26.wav|The top of the phone has 10 screws of it's own holding down three separate sections.
dataset/train/61_27.wav|The bottom section is covering up the motherboard, and a pretty cool looking heat pipe laying
dataset/train/61_28.wav|on the top side of the board.
dataset/train/61_29.wav|And it's probably what helps dissipate the heat up to that refrigerated Fun Cooler that
dataset/train/61_30.wav|we took apart in the durability video.
dataset/train/61_31.wav|It looks like aluminum this time around instead of copper.
dataset/train/61_32.wav|Then we have the metal and glass camera lens which comes off in one unit.
dataset/train/61_33.wav|And then the small portion of top plastics with its top loudspeaker.
dataset/train/61_34.wav|The two stereo speakers are separate from the earpiece, so there are a total of 3 speakers
dataset/train/61_35.wav|inside of the phone.
dataset/train/61_36.wav|I'll take out the dual battery next.
dataset/train/61_37.wav|It's got two connections and two cells divided right down the middle.
dataset/train/61_38.wav|And it's pretty easy to remove with a little help from the pull tabs.
dataset/train/61_39.wav|“Do not remove the battery.”
dataset/train/61_40.wav|Maybe I should read these things before I do the thing they tell me I'm not supposed
dataset/train/61_41.wav|to do.
dataset/train/61_42.wav|This is a 4,500 milliamp hour capacity battery.
dataset/train/61_43.wav|The motherboard is held down with one screw and a few wire ribbons, the dual SIM card
dataset/train/61_44.wav|tray, and the camera ribbons which unsnap like little Legos.
dataset/train/61_45.wav|Then we get our first close up look at the Black Shark 4 motherboard and the integrated
dataset/train/61_46.wav|heat pipe that covers most of its surface.
dataset/train/61_47.wav|The bottom sides of the chip have thermal paste on them and they rest on the copper
dataset/train/61_48.wav|surface that lets heat out through the screen as well.
dataset/train/61_49.wav|I'll pull out the cameras which are mounted into the frame to keep them steady.
dataset/train/61_50.wav|We have the 48 megapixel normal camera which does not have OIS.
dataset/train/61_51.wav|Then the 8 megapixel wide angle camera which also does not have OIS.
dataset/train/61_52.wav|Then over here, the tiny megapixel depth camera which is still attached to the board and also
dataset/train/61_53.wav|does not have the optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/61_54.wav|The thermal cooling system is pretty interesting in this phone.
dataset/train/61_55.wav|It's using solid copper blocks to bridge the gap between the vapor chamber and the processors.
dataset/train/61_56.wav|Kind of like the little copper pillars we saw inside the Legion Duel 2's fan ductwork
dataset/train/61_57.wav|system.
dataset/train/61_58.wav|The vapor chamber looks pretty normal from this side so I'm going to leave the screen
dataset/train/61_59.wav|intact this time around.
dataset/train/61_60.wav|We've had too many gaming phones die recently and we should let this guy live.
dataset/train/61_61.wav|While we're here though, let's take a look at this magnetic trigger system, the one that's
dataset/train/61_62.wav|still magically functioning even though the phone is off.
dataset/train/61_63.wav|The triggers require three different pieces to move up and down and it's rather ingenious.
dataset/train/61_64.wav|The first part is what makes the click happen and we gotta take this part out to see the
dataset/train/61_65.wav|two parts.
dataset/train/61_66.wav|What causes the exterior button to rise up and down though are the magnets.
dataset/train/61_67.wav|There are two magnets: one on the button and one on the slider.
dataset/train/61_68.wav|When the slider is pushed towards the top of the phone, the button collapses and the
dataset/train/61_69.wav|two magnets are attracted to each other which means the magnets are holding the exterior
dataset/train/61_70.wav|button flush with the phone.
dataset/train/61_71.wav|When the slider is shifted down away from the button, the magnet's pulls are positioned
dataset/train/61_72.wav|in a way that they repel each other and the button pushes up.
dataset/train/61_73.wav|Then the slider sits under a lip from the button which helps keep it up in the raised
dataset/train/61_74.wav|position.
dataset/train/61_75.wav|Then both the button and the slider piece get pressed into the third piece, which comes
dataset/train/61_76.wav|into contact with the electronic part of the button setup that relays the press to the
dataset/train/61_77.wav|motherboard.
dataset/train/61_78.wav|Pretty smart design and it's probably quite a bit more efficient than last year's model,
dataset/train/61_79.wav|with dual stepper motors inside.
dataset/train/61_80.wav|And it's definitely easier to build with a lot less parts to worry about.
dataset/train/61_81.wav|And doesn't use any power.
dataset/train/61_82.wav|I'm impressed.
dataset/train/61_83.wav|Overall it's a much easier phone to take apart than last year.
dataset/train/61_84.wav|I'll get the motherboard situated back into the phone with the dual cell battery.
dataset/train/61_85.wav|I think Black Shark has done a good job of implementing new tech, like the dual fast
dataset/train/61_86.wav|charging batteries and pop up triggers, while being one of the lowest price mainstream gaming
dataset/train/61_87.wav|phones.
dataset/train/61_88.wav|And of course it survived the durability test, which apparently for gaming phones is pretty
dataset/train/61_89.wav|hard to do this year.
dataset/train/61_90.wav|With the camera lens and back plastic screwed into place, everything still turns on and
dataset/train/61_91.wav|works like normal.
dataset/train/61_92.wav|The exterior design of the Black Shark 4 might have gotten toned down quite a bit this year,
dataset/train/61_93.wav|but on the inside, where it counts, Black Shark is still getting it done.
dataset/train/61_94.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already.
dataset/train/61_95.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/61_96.wav|And thanks a ton for watching.
dataset/train/61_97.wav|I'll see you around.
dataset/train/61_98.wav|itch
dataset/train/62_1.wav|So it's been a pretty rough year for gaming phones, with both the ROG Phone 5 and the
dataset/train/62_2.wav|Legion Phone 2 getting a game over in their first durability test.
dataset/train/62_3.wav|It's time to see if this Black Shark 4 can hold up any better.
dataset/train/62_4.wav|Today's video is sponsored by Omaze who I partnered up with to give away a brand new,
dataset/train/62_5.wav|custom Tesla Model S and $20,000 in cash that you can keep for yourself or pay it forward.
dataset/train/62_6.wav|Omaze does these massive giveaways while supporting nonprofits.
dataset/train/62_7.wav|And in this particular case we're supporting a nonprofit called Give Power, which helps
dataset/train/62_8.wav|get energy and clean water to regions around the globe that need it.
dataset/train/62_9.wav|I'll explain more at the end of the video, but you can always go to omaze.com/jerry to
dataset/train/62_10.wav|get entered for your chance to win.
dataset/train/62_11.wav|And of course I'll put a link in the description.
dataset/train/62_12.wav|I think it's time we see how durable this Black Shark 4 really is.
dataset/train/62_13.wav|Let's get started.
dataset/train/62_14.wav|The Black Shark 4 is intriguing for multiple reasons, one is it's $500 price point, and
dataset/train/62_15.wav|the other is this active refrigerating coolant we'll get to in a second.
dataset/train/62_16.wav|Inside the box we get a free hard plastic case...kind of nice.
dataset/train/62_17.wav|Free protection is a good thing.
dataset/train/62_18.wav|And then we have the phone itself.
dataset/train/62_19.wav|It's quite a bit different than last year's design.
dataset/train/62_20.wav|Still incredibly flashy like a gaming phone usually is.
dataset/train/62_21.wav|But we are missing the metal X framed across the back panel which means that this bend
dataset/train/62_22.wav|test could be rather interesting.
dataset/train/62_23.wav|It's also got a 1020 watt fast charger in the box.
dataset/train/62_24.wav|Black Shark was one of the first devices to every implement that dual battery charging,
dataset/train/62_25.wav|so I assume that's what's going on again this year.
dataset/train/62_26.wav|120 watts is an impressive amount of power and should get from 0-100% charged in just
dataset/train/62_27.wav|about 17 minutes.
dataset/train/62_28.wav|We'll try out the case just for kicks and giggles.
dataset/train/62_29.wav|I always have a case on my own phone.
dataset/train/62_30.wav|It looks like the case won't be compatible with that refrigerated cooler though so we
dataset/train/62_31.wav|can just take it off for now.
dataset/train/62_32.wav|The other interesting component on this new Black Shark phone is the physical motorized
dataset/train/62_33.wav|popup trigger buttons on the corners.
dataset/train/62_34.wav|Most gaming phones have some kind of capacitive or ultrasonic trigger buttons on the frame,
dataset/train/62_35.wav|but there's something to be said for an actual tactile button.
dataset/train/62_36.wav|These buttons can be mapped to all kinds of different tasks when not in gaming mode.
dataset/train/62_37.wav|And this year instead of motorizing these buttons, this rising action is done with magnets.
dataset/train/62_38.wav|I'm not totally sure how, but I'm sure we'll figure it out from the inside during the teardown,
dataset/train/62_39.wav|you know, if it survives that long.
dataset/train/62_40.wav|Let's talk about the refrigerating cooler for a second.
dataset/train/62_41.wav|Getting rid of the excess heat is a task that every piece of electronics has to deal with.
dataset/train/62_42.wav|Most smartphones have a passive method of cooling with heatpipes and vapor chambers.
dataset/train/62_43.wav|And some have a more active solution like the dual fans inside of the Legion 2...may
dataset/train/62_44.wav|he rest in peace.
dataset/train/62_45.wav|Out of the box, this fun Cooler 2 Pro has a starting temperature of 73 degrees fahrenheit,
dataset/train/62_46.wav|and once I get it plugged into an external power source we instantly get fan movement
dataset/train/62_47.wav|as well as a digital readout of the cooler's temperature.
dataset/train/62_48.wav|And within seconds we've already dropped 20 degrees down to 56 degrees fahrenheit.
dataset/train/62_49.wav|This is an active cooler on steroids and it's surprisingly inexpensive.
dataset/train/62_50.wav|Last year's version only cost like 40 dollars right now.
dataset/train/62_51.wav|We'll leave this over here on the side to see how cold it can really get while we start
dataset/train/62_52.wav|testing this Black Shark 4, starting with the scratch test.
dataset/train/62_53.wav|Xiaomi is nice enough to include a built in screen protector on the Black Shark 4.
dataset/train/62_54.wav|We'll rip that off and test the surface underneath.
dataset/train/62_55.wav|As we know, plastic screens will start scratching a level 2 or 3.
dataset/train/62_56.wav|Glass will start scratching at 5 or 6.
dataset/train/62_57.wav|And sapphire screens will start scratching at level 8 or 9.
dataset/train/62_58.wav|And as we can see from the Black Shark 4, it's made with tempered glass since we get
dataset/train/62_59.wav|scratches starting at level 6, with deeper grooves starting at level 7.
dataset/train/62_60.wav|We haven't run across a plastic screen in a while.
dataset/train/62_61.wav|Our refrigerated cooler is still over there just chilling, now down to 0 degrees celsius.
dataset/train/62_62.wav|My laser temperature thermometer is showing about 38 Fahrenheit which is about 3 degrees
dataset/train/62_63.wav|celsius.
dataset/train/62_64.wav|So it looks like there is a few degrees of discrepancy, but it could also just be that
dataset/train/62_65.wav|the internal thermas location is closer to the cooler than my laser is.
dataset/train/62_66.wav|Either way, it's still pretty impressive.
dataset/train/62_67.wav|Let's keep going.
dataset/train/62_68.wav|The Black Shark 4 does have a tiny hole punch cut out in the screen for that 20 pixel selfie
dataset/train/62_69.wav|camera, and dual stereo speakers.
dataset/train/62_70.wav|The earpiece is covered with a plastic grill that won't be coming off on it's own.
dataset/train/62_71.wav|The side magnetic popup buttons are also made from metal, along with the textured switch
dataset/train/62_72.wav|that activates the rising.
dataset/train/62_73.wav|The buttons seem solid and can't be pried out, or damaged with hammering, which is good
dataset/train/62_74.wav|news.
dataset/train/62_75.wav|The rest of the frame is also metal.
dataset/train/62_76.wav|The side mounted fingerprint reading power button is scratchable, but we'll get to that
dataset/train/62_77.wav|more in a second.
dataset/train/62_78.wav|The top of the phone is pretty empty.
dataset/train/62_79.wav|Then we have the dual SIM card tray and volume rocker on the left side, both of which are
dataset/train/62_80.wav|made from metal.
dataset/train/62_81.wav|The SIM card tray does not include any expandable memory.
dataset/train/62_82.wav|However, the bottom of the phone does have a USB-C and a little friend, the headphone
dataset/train/62_83.wav|jack.
dataset/train/62_84.wav|Another example of an inexpensive phone to rival with more features than the expensive
dataset/train/62_85.wav|ones.
dataset/train/62_86.wav|When I first pulled the Black Shark 4 out of the box, I just assumed the black panel
dataset/train/62_87.wav|was glass.
dataset/train/62_88.wav|Turns out though, it's not.
dataset/train/62_89.wav|It's fine with me though.
dataset/train/62_90.wav|Art Class with Jerry is back in session.
dataset/train/62_91.wav|the fun cooler is now in the negative digits - just below freezing.
dataset/train/62_92.wav|And here on the back of the Black Shark 4 we now have a tooth.
dataset/train/62_93.wav|Pretty accurately sized for a Great White Shark, you know, the massive sharks currently
dataset/train/62_94.wav|swimming around in the ocean today.
dataset/train/62_95.wav|I drew a Great White tooth because if I were to draw an extinct Megalodon tooth it wouldn't
dataset/train/62_96.wav|fit since the largest Megladon tooth ever found is about 7 inches long, and would disappear
dataset/train/62_97.wav|off the top and bottom of the plastic panel.
dataset/train/62_98.wav|How's that for freaky.
dataset/train/62_99.wav|The Black Shark 4 has 3 rear cameras: the main 48 megapixel sensor, then we have an
dataset/train/62_100.wav|8 megapixel wide angle in the middle, followed by a 5 megapixel depth sensor all tucked up
dataset/train/62_101.wav|under the same piece of glass.
dataset/train/62_102.wav|With our freezer over there as cold as ice, it's only fair to bring some heat from the
dataset/train/62_103.wav|opposite end of the temperature spectrum.
dataset/train/62_104.wav|This guy has a 6.6 inch 1080p display, with a 144 hertz refresh rate, and a 720 hertz
dataset/train/62_105.wav|touch sampling rate.
dataset/train/62_106.wav|Pretty similar to that Legion Dual 2.
dataset/train/62_107.wav|This Black Shark 4's AMOLED display lasted about 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter
dataset/train/62_108.wav|before going white, but eventually did recover.
dataset/train/62_109.wav|Before we check out that icicle of a cooler, let's test the side mounted fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/62_110.wav|This has already been scratched so it did take a little longer than normal to set up
dataset/train/62_111.wav|my fingerprint since it was damaged.
dataset/train/62_112.wav|But I'll be honest, I think I prefer this side mounted setup on the power button more
dataset/train/62_113.wav|than I do the under display sensors since if it doesn't register my fingerprint or my
dataset/train/62_114.wav|fingers are wet or dirty, my finger is already on the power button and just makes unlocking
dataset/train/62_115.wav|the phone that much faster.
dataset/train/62_116.wav|I wish more smartphones did it this way.
dataset/train/62_117.wav|Finally, let's see how this refrigerated cooler works from the inside.
dataset/train/62_118.wav|Black Shark is calling this the Fun Cooler 2.
dataset/train/62_119.wav|We had it down to about negative 1 degree celsius when all by itself.
dataset/train/62_120.wav|Clipping it to a warm phone brings it up to about 3 degrees celsius, but that's still
dataset/train/62_121.wav|like playing with your phone inside of a refrigerator.
dataset/train/62_122.wav|Pretty much guaranteed to keep things cool and would allow the internal processor to
dataset/train/62_123.wav|be pushed far beyond its normal capacity.
dataset/train/62_124.wav|There are 3 screws underneath the fan grill, and then we have a thin piece of black rubber,
dataset/train/62_125.wav|which probably helps keep the plastic back of the phone protected from the metal copper
dataset/train/62_126.wav|layer of the cooler.
dataset/train/62_127.wav|There are 4 screws holding that bottom copper to the fan.
dataset/train/62_128.wav|Black Shark is using a thermal electric cooler inside of this thing, sometimes called a Peltier
dataset/train/62_129.wav|Cooler since that's the guy who came up with it back in the 1830's.
dataset/train/62_130.wav|Little did he know though that people would be using his tech to more efficiently throw
dataset/train/62_131.wav|Angry Birds at pigs on their smartphones.
dataset/train/62_132.wav|Welcome to the future.
dataset/train/62_133.wav|The internal board components are covered with a thick rubber waterproofing layer.
dataset/train/62_134.wav|Since the super low temperature differences can literally form ice inside of here in humid
dataset/train/62_135.wav|environments, and you might think that this metal part and these metal fins are for the
dataset/train/62_136.wav|phone, but this is actually made for the backside of the Peltier Cooler since the far side of
dataset/train/62_137.wav|the white freezer chip gets hotter as the side facing the phone gets colder.
dataset/train/62_138.wav|We can see this in action as I plug in the disassembled cooler and remove the freezer
dataset/train/62_139.wav|chip from the backside of the heatsink without the fan and metal cooler to help get rid of
dataset/train/62_140.wav|that heat that the Peltier Cooler is producing, it can get up into the 150 degree range before
dataset/train/62_141.wav|it gets too hot to touch.
dataset/train/62_142.wav|It's pretty cool technology.
dataset/train/62_143.wav|Even cooler is that this pretty much fits any phone, not just the Black Shark 4.
dataset/train/62_144.wav|Peltier chips can also be used to generate the electricity when placed in extreme temperature
dataset/train/62_145.wav|situations, but that's an experiment for a different video.
dataset/train/62_146.wav|It's time to see how well the Black Shark 4, with it's plastic back and popup triggers
dataset/train/62_147.wav|can handle the bend test.
dataset/train/62_148.wav|I'm kind of nervous since the last two gaming phones didn't survive.
dataset/train/62_149.wav|But with a bend from the back, the phone does flex, then locks out and does not break.
dataset/train/62_150.wav|When flipped over and bent from the front, we do get a subtle bend and the screen shrinks
dataset/train/62_151.wav|down into one-handed mode, but nothing is catastrophically broken.
dataset/train/62_152.wav|It's kind of nice having a phone survive again.
dataset/train/62_153.wav|It bends the most right above the power button so I imagine that's where the battery and
dataset/train/62_154.wav|motherboard meet up inside of the device.
dataset/train/62_155.wav|But we won't know for sure until the teardown.
dataset/train/62_156.wav|I'm looking forward to this one.
dataset/train/62_157.wav|Not bad for a $500 gaming phone.
dataset/train/62_158.wav|You just make sure you keep an eye out for all the saltwater Megalodons when you're out
dataset/train/62_159.wav|in the ocean.
dataset/train/62_160.wav|Speaking of the ocean...Like I mentioned earlier, Omaze is a company that works with creators
dataset/train/62_161.wav|to provide experiences and work with nonprofits.
dataset/train/62_162.wav|And for each donation made, you get entered to win super large prizes.
dataset/train/62_163.wav|In this particular case it's a custom Tesla Model S, and $20,000.
dataset/train/62_164.wav|Samantha W. won the Tesla Model 3 Performance in the last dream house giveaway.
dataset/train/62_165.wav|The nonprofit we are supporting is called Give Power.
dataset/train/62_166.wav|There are over 2.2 billion people on the earth that don't have access to clean water, and
dataset/train/62_167.wav|Give Power is able to provide electricity and clean water to those people who need it.
dataset/train/62_168.wav|Give Power is also able to pull salt out of the ocean to make clean drinking water for
dataset/train/62_169.wav|humans, animals, and plants.
dataset/train/62_170.wav|It's pretty cool technology.
dataset/train/62_171.wav|So for your chance to win the custom Tesla Model S and $20,000 in cash, just head to
dataset/train/62_172.wav|Omaze.com/jerry to enter for your chance to win.
dataset/train/62_173.wav|Huge thanks to Omaze for putting this on, bringing awareness to Give Power and making
dataset/train/62_174.wav|things a little more interesting for people who decide to donate.
dataset/train/62_175.wav|Do you think the Black Shark 4 is going to be as complicated to open as the Black Shark
dataset/train/62_176.wav|3?
dataset/train/62_177.wav|Let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/62_178.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already.
dataset/train/62_179.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/62_180.wav|And thanks a ton for watching.
dataset/train/62_181.wav|I'll see you around.
dataset/train/63_1.wav|The Legion Duel 2...pretty much the coolest phone I've ever broken....quite literally,
dataset/train/63_2.wav|since the cooling system inside is pretty epic. Conveniently it's already been cracked
dataset/train/63_3.wav|open a little for us, so the teardown should be rather simple. We've got multiple access
dataset/train/63_4.wav|points. And it looks like even the front camera glass got a little damaged during the durability
dataset/train/63_5.wav|test. The front Gorilla Glass 5 is still going strong though. Let's get started.
dataset/train/63_6.wav|The easiest way to get inside of the Legion Duel 2 is of course with a little heat. And
dataset/train/63_7.wav|then bending the phone into a “c” shape with one hand while inserting the razor blade
dataset/train/63_8.wav|into the elevated slab of glass on the right joycon. The joycon joke is funny because it's
dataset/train/63_9.wav|almost detached. The glass comes up in thirds, and interestingly it does have a little capacitive
dataset/train/63_10.wav|pad on the underside as one of the 8 programmable triggers. We'll have to, you know, find them
dataset/train/63_11.wav|all like some kind of Pokemon quest. Aside from the whole breaking in half thing, this
dataset/train/63_12.wav|phone is legitimately pretty cool.
dataset/train/63_13.wav|The other side of the phone opens up in the same way with another thin ribbon connected
dataset/train/63_14.wav|to another one of the capacitive programmable triggers. Two down, six to go. The inner third
dataset/train/63_15.wav|glass section though is more difficult. It's recessed into the frame with no antenna lines
dataset/train/63_16.wav|or easy suction cup access to help lift off the glass. Eventually I do get some penetration
dataset/train/63_17.wav|with my razor blade, but it still does...break. I hate it when that happens. The goal here,
dataset/train/63_18.wav|of course, is to get access to the internal dual cooling fans and vapor chamber. We get
dataset/train/63_19.wav|our first glimpse of the copper air duct system when that glass is removed.
dataset/train/63_20.wav|First though, the back glass does have LEDs of its own. It looks like there are 6 of them
dataset/train/63_21.wav|that shine into the logo to reflect and refract around inside the white plastic, which of
dataset/train/63_22.wav|course causes the glowy effect we see from the outside of the phone. I'll remove three
dataset/train/63_23.wav|screws so we have access to the fans and stuff. Now normally I think this is supposed to come
dataset/train/63_24.wav|off the phone in one large section, but my phone conveniently is divided into thirds,
dataset/train/63_25.wav|which really does make the assembly much easier. The thin slinky looking ribbon is for the
dataset/train/63_26.wav|dual ultrasonic triggers in the upper corner. Now we've found four of the eight triggers.
dataset/train/63_27.wav|It's a dangerous quest, but you know, someone's gotta do it. I tried removing these ultrasonic
dataset/train/63_28.wav|buttons, but they are very much glued into the frame so this is as close as we can get.
dataset/train/63_29.wav|Here is the bottom stereo speaker, as well as one of the dual haptic vibration motors.
dataset/train/63_30.wav|This same setup is pretty much mirrored on the other side, which we can discover after
dataset/train/63_31.wav|removing 4 more screws and taking off that third of the back housing. We once again see
dataset/train/63_32.wav|two more ultrasonic corner triggers.
dataset/train/63_33.wav|We're now up to 6, along with a dual vibration motor that's still left in the frame. Real
dataset/train/63_34.wav|video game controllers have multiple vibrators, so it's cool to see a gaming phone do the
dataset/train/63_35.wav|same. It's like a portable console that just happens to make phone calls. The other bottom
dataset/train/63_36.wav|loudspeaker is here as well, but there are no balls inside. There are some protections
dataset/train/63_37.wav|against water though, like this red rubber gasket and mesh for the microphone opening.
dataset/train/63_38.wav|Now it's time to take apart the good stuff.
dataset/train/63_39.wav|The center third of this phone is still solidly screwed into place. Some screws have white
dataset/train/63_40.wav|arrows pointing to them which definitely facilitates disassembly, but other screws like this one
dataset/train/63_41.wav|hidden by the popup camera are entirely invisible at first glance, and more difficult to locate.
dataset/train/63_42.wav|Once all the screws are removed, I can unplug the front facing side mounted popup camera
dataset/train/63_43.wav|just like a little Lego, and then we get a close up look at the coolest cooling system
dataset/train/63_44.wav|of the year. There are indeed two fans inside. The larger one with 29 blades at the bottom
dataset/train/63_45.wav|which can suck in air from the back of the phone. Or if the fan is blocked by laying
dataset/train/63_46.wav|flat on a table, it can suck in air from the side of the phone and then pull that air through
dataset/train/63_47.wav|the copper tubing and out through the top where there is another exhaust fan helping
dataset/train/63_48.wav|to escort the air through the vent next to the popup camera. The phone is so complex
dataset/train/63_49.wav|it's rather ingenious. To design something that utilizes every millimeter so efficiency
dataset/train/63_50.wav|is very impressive.
dataset/train/63_51.wav|Once it's out of the rear frame, we can see more clearly the duct work, as well as how
dataset/train/63_52.wav|the entire thing is made from copper and completely hollow inside. Lenovo says this system keeps
dataset/train/63_53.wav|the Qualcomm 888 processor 30% cooler than other phones that have the same chip and I
dataset/train/63_54.wav|believe it. The copper ductwork looks like it's even laser welded shut. There are two
dataset/train/63_55.wav|additional copper pillars heading down to the main vapor chamber next to the cameras,
dataset/train/63_56.wav|but I'll show you that more in a second. You know the phone is pretty interesting when
dataset/train/63_57.wav|the stepper motor for the front popup camera is the most boring thing we have to look at.
dataset/train/63_58.wav|The front earpiece speaker has a layer of the largest waterproofing mesh we've ever
dataset/train/63_59.wav|seen. I still wouldn't trust the phone to be totally waterresitant, but at least there
dataset/train/63_60.wav|is protection. I'll pop off the metal bracket on the stacked motherboard and unclip some
dataset/train/63_61.wav|more Lego-style connections along with quite a few signal wires that all head out to those
dataset/train/63_62.wav|infamous antenna lines. Not a whole lot else on this board so we'll move onto the dual
dataset/train/63_63.wav|batteries – one on either side of the phone.
dataset/train/63_64.wav|There are no magic pull tabs this time around, but when they do get pulled out with brute
dataset/train/63_65.wav|force, we get a glimpse of the force touch sensor under the display as one of the final
dataset/train/63_66.wav|8 trigger locations. There's one on either side and our quest is now complete. Now I'm
dataset/train/63_67.wav|usually pretty surprised when companies send me a phone to, you know, review. It's definitely
dataset/train/63_68.wav|a brave move since my reviews aren't really considered conventional. This Legion Duel
dataset/train/63_69.wav|2 was sent in a retail box with a factory seal, but each of the 2,750 milliamp hour
dataset/train/63_70.wav|batteries say “engineering sample” on them. So it does make you wonder if Lenovo
dataset/train/63_71.wav|really was ready to show this off. I think the most logical explanation is that I probably
dataset/train/63_72.wav|got included on the list of popular YouTubers and just got sent a phone without Lenovo really
dataset/train/63_73.wav|checking to see who I am or what I do. And if that is indeed the case, I'd like to say:
dataset/train/63_74.wav|Hello, Lenovo. It's nice to meet you. And I hope we didn't start this off on the wrong
dataset/train/63_75.wav|foot.
dataset/train/63_76.wav|With the motherboard released we can take a look at the 64 megapixel main camera, which
dataset/train/63_77.wav|does not have OIS. And then we have the 16 megapixel wide angle camera which also does
dataset/train/63_78.wav|not have OIS. We do have a lot of copper and thermal paste on the back though, which brings
dataset/train/63_79.wav|us to the vapor chamber. Pay attention to these two little copper posts which connect
dataset/train/63_80.wav|the copper air ducts from the cooling fan down to the copper vapor chamber onto the
dataset/train/63_81.wav|screen. A lot of planning has gone into this design...well, functional planning...not so
dataset/train/63_82.wav|much structural planning. With the screen now separated from the mid plate, we get our
dataset/train/63_83.wav|first look at the rather large vapor chamber. And would you look at that. My fingerprint
dataset/train/63_84.wav|scanner hypothesis was correct. It does not have a lens, it's just the flat sensor, which
dataset/train/63_85.wav|for me usually struggles a bit more reading my fingerprints. I prefer the lens style or
dataset/train/63_86.wav|the ultrasonic. Currently, Sony has the record for the largest vapor chamber inside of a
dataset/train/63_87.wav|cell phone, but Lenovo is right there as well with the massive chamber all of their own.
dataset/train/63_88.wav|It feels a bit more thin than Sony's, so I think Sony's still the leader. But it's still
dataset/train/63_89.wav|impressive. Sometimes we can see liquid quickly evaporate from inside the chamber when I cut
dataset/train/63_90.wav|it. But even after quickly lifting up the copper flaps, I don't see any liquid this
dataset/train/63_91.wav|time around. Here's a closeup look at the copper wicking inside of the vapor chamber
dataset/train/63_92.wav|though. This is what helps wick the liquid inside of the chamber. And here is a close
dataset/train/63_93.wav|up look at those copper posts that help move the heat from the vapor chamber up to the
dataset/train/63_94.wav|copper air ducts so the fan can pull it out and blow it away from the phone. Little conductive
dataset/train/63_95.wav|nuggets of calcification. And to nobody's surprise, there are two of them, just like
dataset/train/63_96.wav|everything else in the phone.
dataset/train/63_97.wav|All in all, I'd say that the Legion Duel 2 is one of the most interesting phones we've
dataset/train/63_98.wav|ever seen the insides of. And whether it was on accident or on purpose, I'm glad Lenovo
dataset/train/63_99.wav|sent it over. And I'm already looking forward to next year, assuming, of course, we're still
dataset/train/63_100.wav|friends. And remember, no matter what phone you have, it should probably be in a case.
dataset/train/63_101.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/63_102.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/64_1.wav|Remember Craig? Today it's time we take apart the 108 megapixel smartphone that only costs
dataset/train/64_2.wav|$300...you know, a little autopsy. We'll compare the sensor size of the Realme 8 Pro to the
dataset/train/64_3.wav|108 megapixel sensor inside of the Note 20 Ultra. Both camera sensors are made by Samsung,
dataset/train/64_4.wav|and it'll be interesting to see them both side by side...from the inside. This video
dataset/train/64_5.wav|is sponsored by Raycon. Raycon's are wireless earbuds that cost half the price of other
dataset/train/64_6.wav|premium brands. With their super small footprint, compact design, and long battery life I use
dataset/train/64_7.wav|them for working out or running outside. It's easier to exercise when there's no wires to
dataset/train/64_8.wav|deal with. These Raycons have 6 hours of play time on their own, and 24 hours of total play
dataset/train/64_9.wav|time with that charging case. And the coolest thing is that Raycon is so confident in their
dataset/train/64_10.wav|earbuds, they'll let you try it risk free for 45 days. To get your own pair just click
dataset/train/64_11.wav|the link in the description, or head to Raycon.com/jerryrigeverything for 15% off your order. There are different
dataset/train/64_12.wav|colors to choose from. And huge thanks to Raycon for sponsoring this video and supporting
dataset/train/64_13.wav|the channel.
dataset/train/64_14.wav|Now we already know Craig survived the durability test, but it's time to see if he survives
dataset/train/64_15.wav|the teardown. Let's get started.
dataset/train/64_16.wav|Opening up the back of my Teardown Skin Samsung Note 20 Ultra is pretty easy. Since I never
dataset/train/64_17.wav|really added more adhesive to that back glass panel. You can see the 108 megapixel sensor
dataset/train/64_18.wav|just chilling there in the middle. The Realme 8 Pro is still glued shut and it's a little
dataset/train/64_19.wav|more difficult, but I can persuade it to open up with a little heat and my razor blade.
dataset/train/64_20.wav|The suction cup does not stick to the rough edge surface...but that's okay. Since removing
dataset/train/64_21.wav|the plastic back is much easier than removing a glass back, I don't have to worry about
dataset/train/64_22.wav|this one cracking or shattering. I did however forget that Craig is still turned on. I would
dataset/train/64_23.wav|make a terrible doctor.
dataset/train/64_24.wav|Once all the adhesive is sliced away from around the edges, the back panel peels off,
dataset/train/64_25.wav|leaving the stove top camera lens behind. The camera lens comes off on its own as a
dataset/train/64_26.wav|separate piece. Then I can remove the 19 screws holding down the back plastics to the frame
dataset/train/64_27.wav|of the 8 Pro. Now this is where things get a little different. Instead of the back plastics
dataset/train/64_28.wav|being just the back plastics, this time around they also include the side plastics. I'll
dataset/train/64_29.wav|pull out the ever given size SIM card tray, and then work my way around the edge of the
dataset/train/64_30.wav|phone between the screen and the frame to pop off all the exterior plastics at the same
dataset/train/64_31.wav|time. Kind of cool. I'll unplug the battery just like a little Lego. And then we can get
dataset/train/64_32.wav|a look at the bottom loud speaker. No foam balls this time around, but there is a coin
dataset/train/64_33.wav|style vibration motor attached to the plastics, as well as a water proofing mesh over the
dataset/train/64_34.wav|speaker opening. The Realme 8 Pro doesn't have an official water resistance rating,
dataset/train/64_35.wav|but it does still have quite a bit of water proofing inside of the phone...like this mesh
dataset/train/64_36.wav|and rubber gasket around the microphone hole on the bottom. I still wouldn't trust it to
dataset/train/64_37.wav|be watertight though, but it's good to see there are precautions in place.
dataset/train/64_38.wav|I'll peel up the little green flap on the battery and give it a little tug. And nice
dataset/train/64_39.wav|work, Realme. Removable batteries are the way to go. Even Craig approves. This is a
dataset/train/64_40.wav|4,500 milliamp hour capacity battery, and pretty big for a phone this expensive. I'll
dataset/train/64_41.wav|pop out the extension ribbons, and then make my way to the underscreen fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/64_42.wav|This optical reader does have a lens on it instead of just being a flat sensor. The lens
dataset/train/64_43.wav|type seems to typically work better for me and my fingers. Then we have the bottom board
dataset/train/64_44.wav|with the USB-C port, as well as our buddy the headphone jack. Jack and Craig are friends.
dataset/train/64_45.wav|With a few more connections and one more screw holding down the motherboard, we finally get
dataset/train/64_46.wav|a good look at those cameras. Normally cameras that work together are also sitting together
dataset/train/64_47.wav|in some kind of metal housing to keep them all aligned and situated under that camera
dataset/train/64_48.wav|lens. But that's not the case this time around. Each camera is kind of free floating and actually
dataset/train/64_49.wav|kind of small. For example, usually the fingerprint scanner is the smallest camera sensor in the
dataset/train/64_50.wav|phone by far. But this time around the fingerprint scanner feels right at home, next to the two
dataset/train/64_51.wav|macro and depth cameras, each of which are 2 megapixels. The motherboard still has the
dataset/train/64_52.wav|16 megapixel front facing selfie camera attached to it with the ribbon cable. And it has some
dataset/train/64_53.wav|thermal paste on the back to help dissipate heat into that metal sub frame. This large
dataset/train/64_54.wav|metal sub frame is probably what helped the phone survive the bend test, with it's boxy
dataset/train/64_55.wav|rails along the side to help add structure and rigidity to the phone.
dataset/train/64_56.wav|So Samsung does make the 108 megapixel sensors that reside in each of these phones. And we
dataset/train/64_57.wav|can see that the sensor itself is different between the two models. The Realme 8 Pro's
dataset/train/64_58.wav|footprint being much smaller by a pretty considerable amount. Larger sensors don't always mean better
dataset/train/64_59.wav|sensors of course, but having more surface real estate to absorb light is generally considered
dataset/train/64_60.wav|a good thing. The Realme 8 Pro's 108 megapixel sensor does not have optical image stabilization,
dataset/train/64_61.wav|which might also explain the slightly smaller footprint. I'll use my razor blade to separate
dataset/train/64_62.wav|the lens from the sensor so we can get a better look at the internals. This does kill the
dataset/train/64_63.wav|camera, but I think it's worth it.
dataset/train/64_64.wav|The internal sensor of the Realme 8 Pro measures about 8 millimeters across, which is interesting
dataset/train/64_65.wav|because both the S20 Ultra and the Mi Note 10 Pro's 108 megapixel cameras measured about
dataset/train/64_66.wav|10 millimeters across. So it looks like Samsung has managed to make a slightly smaller sensor
dataset/train/64_67.wav|that's still capable of capturing 108 megapixels. It'll be interesting to see the different
dataset/train/64_68.wav|side by side camera comparisons between the cameras. Maybe it will make an appearance
dataset/train/64_69.wav|in MKBHD's blind camera test at the end of the year.
dataset/train/64_70.wav|Overall though, I'm a pretty big fan of the price point. I can basically buy three Realme
dataset/train/64_71.wav|8 Pro's for the price of one Samsung Note 20 Ultra. Both phones are boasting 108 megapixel
dataset/train/64_72.wav|cameras, and only one of which has a headphone jack...and, of course, Craig, who is extremely
dataset/train/64_73.wav|happy to still be alive....mostly alive. The camera doesn't work anymore, probably because
dataset/train/64_74.wav|I ripped it in half. The camera app just opens and freezes. But everything else seems to
dataset/train/64_75.wav|be working just fine so no complaints here.
dataset/train/64_76.wav|Craig says to hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with us
dataset/train/64_77.wav|on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. We'll see you around.
dataset/train/65_1.wav|Well, here we are again with another gaming phone. Gaming phones are usually the coolest
dataset/train/65_2.wav|phones and some of my favorites because they push the limits with both design and specs...both of
dataset/train/65_3.wav|which can obviously be utilized by everyone, even if gaming isn't your main thing. I didn't really
dataset/train/65_4.wav|know Lenovo made smartphones until now. I did use one of their laptops all through college though,
dataset/train/65_5.wav|so they have been around for a long time. Opening up the box we get our first glimpse of the phone.
dataset/train/65_6.wav|Lenovo sent me their Legion Phone Duel 2 to check out
dataset/train/65_7.wav|with a box that's surprisingly optically stabilized. Already innovative...I like it.
dataset/train/65_8.wav|Inside the box we get dual USB-C cables, and a charging brick that has dual USB-C
dataset/train/65_9.wav|ports. I'm beginning to see why they call this the Duel 2. When both ports are plugged in and
dataset/train/65_10.wav|used at the same time, we can apparently juice up the phone with 90 watts of power.
dataset/train/65_11.wav|I'll get to that more in a second. The phone is resting on one more box. I'll pull them both
dataset/train/65_12.wav|out. And in here we get a little headphone jack adapter, as well as a thin clear plastic case.
dataset/train/65_13.wav|And finally, the phone itself. This is one of the most unique looking phones we've seen in a while.
dataset/train/65_14.wav|It's got curves in the weirdest places. I'm looking forward to this one. Let's get started.
dataset/train/65_15.wav|Right off the bat this phone feels like a solid chunk of brick. It's heavy, thick,
dataset/train/65_16.wav|and long, with a very strange abnormal growth in the center. Apparently this center hump is
dataset/train/65_17.wav|for the brains of the whole operation, while the dual batteries are off in the wings. In
dataset/train/65_18.wav|the hump we've got the center mounted cameras, as well as the RGB leds, and, most importantly,
dataset/train/65_19.wav|the dual fans. We've seen one fan before in a cell phone, in the Red Magic gaming phones,
dataset/train/65_20.wav|but not two. Taking apart this Duel 2 should be pretty interesting.
dataset/train/65_21.wav|But first things first, the scratch test. I have a set of Mohs mineral picks that help
dataset/train/65_22.wav|differentiate between different minerals and materials. And every now and then we
dataset/train/65_23.wav|have a phone slip into the system that's hiding under a plastic screen protector.
dataset/train/65_24.wav|Doesn't take too long to figure out that this Duel 2's incredibly unique anatomy might come with some
dataset/train/65_25.wav|issues. Normally the camera bump is up top so the phone rocks left and right. But this time around
dataset/train/65_26.wav|with the camel hump in the middle, the phone is rocking top to bottom like a giant seesaw.
dataset/train/65_27.wav|Not necessarily a bad thing, but I could see it getting a little annoying trying to one hand type
dataset/train/65_28.wav|a message while the phone is laying on a flat surface. It'll bounce around like a bobble head.
dataset/train/65_29.wav|Finishing up the scratch test we see that the screen is made from tempered glass by
dataset/train/65_30.wav|it's scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. This is the part where we normally
dataset/train/65_31.wav|go find the front facing camera, but as you can clearly see, this phone does not have one...at
dataset/train/65_32.wav|least not where we would normally expect it. It's got a side mounted motorized popup camera hidden
dataset/train/65_33.wav|underneath the power button. I didn't see that one coming. It's a loud little guy. Apparently it's
dataset/train/65_34.wav|here on the side so that gamers can livestream themselves playing games while the phone is being
dataset/train/65_35.wav|held horizontally. And it makes quite a bit of sense. And since the camera is motorized,
dataset/train/65_36.wav|it's not taking up any pixel real estate inside that display. Pressing the power button, which
dataset/train/65_37.wav|is now extended up into the air, still turns off the screen and retracts the camera. It's kind of
dataset/train/65_38.wav|weird if you want to take normal vertical selfies of course, but definitely not a deal breaker.
dataset/train/65_39.wav|The lens on the front of the camera is made from glass, and is scratch resistant, and impressively
dataset/train/65_40.wav|has 44 megapixels. The camera also has fall protection which we've seen on other popup
dataset/train/65_41.wav|camera smartphones, where it tries to retract before hitting the ground if it's ever dropped.
dataset/train/65_42.wav|The large earpiece speaker grill is made from plastic and won't be falling out on it's own.
dataset/train/65_43.wav|It's also one of a pair. Dual loudspeakers on a phone where everything is dual. The bottom
dataset/train/65_44.wav|stereo speaker grill is also made from plastic. The right side of the phone is made from metal,
dataset/train/65_45.wav|and there's a whole lot going on. No mechanical popup buttons like we saw on the Black Shark
dataset/train/65_46.wav|3 gaming phone, but there are a total of four ultrasonic programmable gaming buttons on this
dataset/train/65_47.wav|side alone – two on the right side. And then we have the textured metal power button sitting on
dataset/train/65_48.wav|top of the motorized camera. And then, of course, the output vent from the internal dual fans
dataset/train/65_49.wav|which we'll get to in a second. And then the other pair of programmable buttons on the top side.
dataset/train/65_50.wav|The top of the phone is pretty empty. Then over here on the left side of the phone
dataset/train/65_51.wav|we have the metal volume rocker and one of the two USB-C ports.
dataset/train/65_52.wav|The second USB-C port, of course, is down at the bottom where it normally is
dataset/train/65_53.wav|next to the dual SIM card tray which has a slot on either side for SIM cards.
dataset/train/65_54.wav|We'll talk more about the USB-C ports in a second.
dataset/train/65_55.wav|The back of the phone is interesting of course, like a turtle. We've never seen anything quite
dataset/train/65_56.wav|like it. There are an additional two programmable capacitive buttons under that slope of the rear
dataset/train/65_57.wav|glass leading up to the center camera mountain. All of these rear surfaces of course are made
dataset/train/65_58.wav|from glass. And as we know, a gaming phone can't be a gaming phone without some sweet LED action.
dataset/train/65_59.wav|There are two cameras included on Everest here. One is a 64 megapixel main sensor,
dataset/train/65_60.wav|and the other is a 16 megapixel wide angle lens – both protected under that same piece of glass.
dataset/train/65_61.wav|And, of course, the fans, which are both back here as well.
dataset/train/65_62.wav|Now supposedly this fan contraption is specially oriented over the vapor chamber, which helps with
dataset/train/65_63.wav|the dissipation. And supposedly, both fans are IP58, meaning that it's protected against water.
dataset/train/65_64.wav|But we'll have to see how that's even possible from the inside during the teardown video.
dataset/train/65_65.wav|The fans are pretty quiet, and I can get them going full blast with rampage mode.
dataset/train/65_66.wav|They are tiny little guys though, with 29 blades each. The intake fan is spinning at 12,500rpm,
dataset/train/65_67.wav|and the exhaust fan is spinning at 15,000rpm.
dataset/train/65_68.wav|Lenovo says the fans are capable of lowering the internal temperature of the Qualcomm 888 processor
dataset/train/65_69.wav|by over 30% compared to other smartphones that have the same chip, which is pretty impressive and
dataset/train/65_70.wav|definitely a worthwhile addition to the phone. If I get little pieces of paper sprinkled on my desk,
dataset/train/65_71.wav|we can see the exhaust fan moving them a little bit, but it's still a pretty small blower. I
dataset/train/65_72.wav|ripped a thread out of my shirt so we can see it a little clearer. A little wisp blowing in the
dataset/train/65_73.wav|gentle breeze. A gentle breeze that of course helps you kill your enemies more efficiently.
dataset/train/65_74.wav|Speaking of vanquishing enemies efficiently, it does take a lot of energy, and the Legion Phone
dataset/train/65_75.wav|Duel 2 has plenty of that. As you've guessed, there are dual batteries – one on either side
dataset/train/65_76.wav|of the phone, which is a little worrisome since the dual battery situation didn't work out too
dataset/train/65_77.wav|well for the ROG Phone 5. But let's keep our fingers crossed that Lenovo's done it better.
dataset/train/65_78.wav|Both of these ports can be used to charge up the batteries. When I plug in one of the cables it
dataset/train/65_79.wav|turns on turbo charging. And when both of them get plugged in, it turns on dual turbo charging,
dataset/train/65_80.wav|which pumps 90 watts of power into the phone to charge the massive 5,500 milliamp battery
dataset/train/65_81.wav|to 100% in just 30 minutes...which has also got to be some kind of record.
dataset/train/65_82.wav|Finally, the burn test. We'll make things a little more interesting this time around with a little
dataset/train/65_83.wav|help from the fans. It's easy to tell that this is intact by the way it's ingesting the flame
dataset/train/65_84.wav|internally. Digesting fire is generally frowned upon, but you got to admit, it looks pretty cool.
dataset/train/65_85.wav|The exhaust vent is also strong enough to blow out my lighter, which is pretty impressive.
dataset/train/65_86.wav|And at least now we know the fans are good at working in extremely hot environments.
dataset/train/65_87.wav|The screen of the Duel 2 is a 6.9 inch 1080p display, with a 144hz refresh rate. And,
dataset/train/65_88.wav|most impressively, a 720hz touch sampling rate...which I'm pretty sure is another
dataset/train/65_89.wav|record. The touch sampling rate is almost more important than the refresh rate while gaming
dataset/train/65_90.wav|since it's how fast the screen can sense what your fingers are doing. And then, of course,
dataset/train/65_91.wav|the AMOLED display does last for about 33 seconds under the heat from my lighter
dataset/train/65_92.wav|and does not fully recover. Now again, fingerprint scanners are not my favorite,
dataset/train/65_93.wav|but I do have a theory about scanners that don't work very well. Usually it's the flat
dataset/train/65_94.wav|optical scanners with a sensor and no lens that can't read my fingerprint. And since this phone
dataset/train/65_95.wav|is struggling to even set my fingerprint, it'll be interesting to see if my hypothesis
dataset/train/65_96.wav|is correct when we open it up from the inside. I'm guessing the optical scanner doesn't have a lens.
dataset/train/65_97.wav|Now, when I first picked up this phone, I noticed that it's extremely heavy, to the point where I'm
dataset/train/65_98.wav|not even remotely concerned about it breaking. But, you know, there are some weird shapes and
dataset/train/65_99.wav|structural designs going on. And, well, turns out there is a weaker gaming phone than the ROG 5. The
dataset/train/65_100.wav|Legion Phone Duel 2, with it's two speakers, two fans, and two batteries, is now most definitely
dataset/train/65_101.wav|in two pieces. The display is shattered and destroyed underneath that Gorilla Glass 5,
dataset/train/65_102.wav|which surprisingly is still intact. At first close up glance at the breaking point,
dataset/train/65_103.wav|it looks like pitted porous metal was the culprit of the break.
dataset/train/65_104.wav|But it turns out it's a clean snap right along that antenna line, which match up on either
dataset/train/65_105.wav|side of the glass hump. The antenna lines are usually plastic to allow the phone to get its
dataset/train/65_106.wav|signal since antennas don't work well through metal. Unfortunately though, these same antenna
dataset/train/65_107.wav|lines are also symmetrically mirrored at the other end of the camera mountain, which means
dataset/train/65_108.wav|the Legion Phone 2 is now the Legion Phone 3...as in it's in 3 pieces. If those antenna
dataset/train/65_109.wav|lines were positioned differently or reinforced internally, this might have gone differently.
dataset/train/65_110.wav|The front glass is still intact though. Nice work, Corning. A bad year for gaming phones really shows
dataset/train/65_111.wav|how well Gorilla Glass holds up. The Legion Phone Duel 2 does not pass my durability test.
dataset/train/65_112.wav|Now remember, durability is just one aspect of choosing your next phone. A simple case will
dataset/train/65_113.wav|solve the majority of structural issues. And just because I broke it does not make it a bad phone.
dataset/train/65_114.wav|It just gives us an idea of what to look out for and what situations to avoid while owning it.
dataset/train/65_115.wav|It's a super cool phone, literally and figuratively,
dataset/train/65_116.wav|internally and externally. Just don't sit on it. The teardown will still be pretty
dataset/train/65_117.wav|interesting. We'll check out those fans from the inside, as well as the supposedly massive
dataset/train/65_118.wav|vapor chamber. So hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/65_119.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/66_1.wav|So OnePlus thought it would be funny if instead of sending me a complete phone to take apart,
dataset/train/66_2.wav|they would send me a completely taken apart phone to see if I could put it all back together...you
dataset/train/66_3.wav|know, like a joke. Lucky for them though, I too am extremely humorous and I accept this
dataset/train/66_4.wav|build up challenge. Personally, I think OnePlus should ship everyone's phones like this. I do
dataset/train/66_5.wav|still have the phone that I did my durability test on. The parts that I'm most interested
dataset/train/66_6.wav|in seeing from the inside are the screen, and of course, this new Hasselblad camera setup.
dataset/train/66_7.wav|I've never attempted something like this before. Starting someone's phone repair midway through
dataset/train/66_8.wav|so it should be interesting. Thanks OnePlus for sponsoring this challenge. Let's get started.
dataset/train/66_9.wav|Of course the goal here is to not have any screws left over, but like any great DIY'er would say,
dataset/train/66_10.wav|that's just the goal and not necessarily a requirement. The first thing I notice
dataset/train/66_11.wav|besides this mountain of components is the slightly curved display. It's glued to the
dataset/train/66_12.wav|frame like most other smartphones and it's got the vapor chamber peeking out from behind the frame.
dataset/train/66_13.wav|This copper chamber helps catch the heat that the phone generates while gaming or charging.
dataset/train/66_14.wav|And it releases that heat through the thin layer of pixels on the front. We'll get a closer look
dataset/train/66_15.wav|at that later if we're successful in getting the phone to turn on. OnePlus is using an LTPO low
dataset/train/66_16.wav|temperature polycrystalline oxide OLED panel. This accomplishes a few things. One, it's thin enough
dataset/train/66_17.wav|that the heat from the phone escapes through the screen. And two, it can dynamically change it's
dataset/train/66_18.wav|refresh rate from 120 hertz, all the way down to 1 hertz, depending on what the phone is doing, which
dataset/train/66_19.wav|should help out the battery life considerably. Speaking of which, let's start building the phone.
dataset/train/66_20.wav|There are a total of 6 cameras inside this guy. The underscreen fingerprint scanner
dataset/train/66_21.wav|is by far the smallest. As you can see when I place it next to the main cameras,
dataset/train/66_22.wav|the Hasselblad tuned sensors are ginormous and we'll get to those more in a second. With the tiny
dataset/train/66_23.wav|optical fingerprint scanner in place, I can hunt around for that vibrator. It's kind of strange
dataset/train/66_24.wav|assembling something I didn't disassemble. This here is a rectangular haptic vibrator. OnePlus did
dataset/train/66_25.wav|also send me this cute little instruction booklet, but we definitely won't be needing it. I got this.
dataset/train/66_26.wav|Next we got the battery...or batteries, since there are two of them side by side,
dataset/train/66_27.wav|for a total of 4500 milliamp hours. It does have dual pull tabs, which are nice for easy removal.
dataset/train/66_28.wav|Dual batteries means the phone is able to be charged up twice as fast as normal phones.
dataset/train/66_29.wav|OnePlus says their 9 Pro can go from 1% to 100% in just 29 minutes. To me, that sounds a little
dataset/train/66_30.wav|too good to be true. So I tested it out myself by plugging in my durability tested phone on
dataset/train/66_31.wav|the Warp Charge 65T, while it was at exactly 1%. And it turns out OnePlus lied a little. Instead
dataset/train/66_32.wav|of completely charging my phone in 29 minutes, my phone completely charged in 27 minutes. Nice work,
dataset/train/66_33.wav|OnePlus. Thumbs up for that. This is also the same battery inside of the regular OnePlus 9.
dataset/train/66_34.wav|Let's get back to the teardown. It's easy to tell where the SIM card tray goes since there
dataset/train/66_35.wav|is an opening right outside the phone. It's next to the water damage indicator. The OnePlus 9 Pro
dataset/train/66_36.wav|is ip68 water resistant. Once I get the bottom board situated in place, I realize that that
dataset/train/66_37.wav|charging port ribbon only fits in underneath that SIM card board. So if you all just want
dataset/train/66_38.wav|to close your eyes for a second, we can just pretend that I did this in the correct order.
dataset/train/66_39.wav|Now, with everything situated, we do have that lower loudspeaker which I can check for balls.
dataset/train/66_40.wav|And indeed, under that black sticker we have a plethora of sound dampening foam balls.
dataset/train/66_41.wav|This helps the stereo sound bigger and better than it actually is.
dataset/train/66_42.wav|I'll get the extension ribbon plugged into the bottom board just like a little Lego.
dataset/train/66_43.wav|Then I can screw in the bottom board and the top covering piece with its 8 screws.
dataset/train/66_44.wav|The rest of the cool tech is up top. If you all just want to close your eyes again for a second.
dataset/train/66_45.wav|So the next thing we're going to install, which I figured out all on my own, is the motherboard.
dataset/train/66_46.wav|The motherboard is unique this time around since it has one of the three 5G antennas built directly
dataset/train/66_47.wav|onto the surface of the board. Then on the backside is where we have the snapdragon 888
dataset/train/66_48.wav|processor, with it's thermal paste that helps transfer the heat out through the screen.
dataset/train/66_49.wav|I'll get the other frame mounted 5G antenna stuck into the right side of the phone.
dataset/train/66_50.wav|This is kind of like playing one of those baby shape puzzles, except for adults.
dataset/train/66_51.wav|I'll get the 3rd 5G antenna plugged in. It's ribbon cable reaches across the phone
dataset/train/66_52.wav|to be near the others, and it's good to know where all the 5G antennas are at.
dataset/train/66_53.wav|Finally, there are a few signal wires to pin in place before we can get to those cameras.
dataset/train/66_54.wav|The cameras are definitely my favorite part of the phone, not only because Hasselblad is
dataset/train/66_55.wav|helping out this time around. They do seem like a really cool company after capturing
dataset/train/66_56.wav|the Apollo space missions. But the sensors themselves have a super massive footprint.
dataset/train/66_57.wav|This is the 50 megapixel wide angle camera which has the largest ultra
dataset/train/66_58.wav|wide sensor on any smartphone. There is no OIS, but there is a special free form lens
dataset/train/66_59.wav|that keeps the edge distortion of the pictures to 1%, which is a pretty big deal for wide angle.
dataset/train/66_60.wav|The main 48 megapixel camera does have optical image stabilization, along with Hasselblad's
dataset/train/66_61.wav|natural color calibration, and the ability to see 68 billion colors in the 12-bit pro mode.
dataset/train/66_62.wav|Hasselblad has color-tuned all of these cameras...well, all of them but the fingerprint
dataset/train/66_63.wav|scanner probably. The imaging processing software on the OnePlus 9 Pro has also been updated with
dataset/train/66_64.wav|Hasselblad's UI, so everything still has that professional feel. The bottom 2 megapixel
dataset/train/66_65.wav|monochrome camera works hand in hand with that main sensor. And then we have the 8 megapixel
dataset/train/66_66.wav|telephoto camera, which also has the OIS. And they fit snugly up here into the top left corner,
dataset/train/66_67.wav|tucked up to the edge so they don't split the motherboard like they would if they were sitting
dataset/train/66_68.wav|in the center. This also helps keep the camera hump to a minimum, and keeps the phone more thin.
dataset/train/66_69.wav|The front facing camera is a 16 megapixel little guy. I'll just tuck him up here into
dataset/train/66_70.wav|the frame. The motherboard has two screws holding everything in place.
dataset/train/66_71.wav|Then I can get the batteries connected with their single connector and the final extension ribbon.
dataset/train/66_72.wav|The last thing we need to install before we see if this phone works is the wireless charger.
dataset/train/66_73.wav|OnePlus is calling this Warp Charge 50 wireless, which is kind of a mouthful,
dataset/train/66_74.wav|but it can wirelessly charge the phone from one percent to 100 percent in just 43 minutes,
dataset/train/66_75.wav|which is even faster than most wire chargers out there.
dataset/train/66_76.wav|The copper coils inside this wireless charging pad have been increased 10%, and it hits that 50
dataset/train/66_77.wav|watts of charging by juicing up both batteries at the same time. Still pretty impressive.
dataset/train/66_78.wav|With the back plastics installed and the dual colored LED flash plugged in,
dataset/train/66_79.wav|along with those 9 additional screws holding everything together, we finally see if the
dataset/train/66_80.wav|OnePlus 9 Pro will turn on. And would you look at that! Success. The frame of the OnePlus 9 Pro
dataset/train/66_81.wav|is 2.2 millimeters thick. I'll get this morning mist colored curved rear glass panel installed
dataset/train/66_82.wav|back on the back. And we can test out Hasselblad's cameras to see if everything is still working.
dataset/train/66_83.wav|I never even doubted. It's definitely interesting trying to build a phone that I didn't take apart
dataset/train/66_84.wav|in the first place, but still pretty fun. I only had one screw and one little metal bracket left
dataset/train/66_85.wav|over...and I'm still not sure where these are supposed to go. So if you saw a spot I missed,
dataset/train/66_86.wav|let me know down in the comments. Maybe OnePlus tossed extra parts in as another joke.
dataset/train/66_87.wav|But if you close your eyes for a second...boom! No more left over parts. Nailed it.
dataset/train/66_88.wav|I'm looking forward to this OnePlus and Hasselblad partnership. Two cool companies working together
dataset/train/66_89.wav|is going to benefit everyone. As always, let me know what you think down in the comments. Come
dataset/train/66_90.wav|hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/67_1.wav|I've been asked to do durability tests on some budget smartphones.
dataset/train/67_2.wav|And at around $300, I think this Realme 8 Pro falls into that category. While at the same
dataset/train/67_3.wav|time having some pretty impressive specs all of its own. The Realme 8 Pro comes with a flexible
dataset/train/67_4.wav|rubber case which is nice. Free protection is always a good thing. And it also comes with
dataset/train/67_5.wav|an excessively loud design. While some matte finish smartphones are subtle,
dataset/train/67_6.wav|the brightly etched surface of this Realme 8 Pro is super rough.
dataset/train/67_7.wav|Nearing like 800 grit sandpaper, if you know what I mean. It's the most etched
dataset/train/67_8.wav|back panel I've ever seen. And with that “Dare to Leap” logo, it'll be recognizable for miles.
dataset/train/67_9.wav|Another thing that will go for miles is the 108 megapixel camera.
dataset/train/67_10.wav|Realme sent over three of these phones for me to test,
dataset/train/67_11.wav|which is pretty brave of them since I only need just one. Each color is equally loud
dataset/train/67_12.wav|and has an almost 3D depth to it with the etching that's freaking my camera out. But I think we're
dataset/train/67_13.wav|getting ahead of ourselves here, so I'll set these off to the side. If this Realme 8 Pro survives
dataset/train/67_14.wav|my durability test, I'll give away his two friends to some of you guys. Let's get started.
dataset/train/67_15.wav|The back panel of this phone is anything but subtle or normal. With a budget phone
dataset/train/67_16.wav|you are never really sure what you're going to get...metal, glass, or plastic. Plastic,
dataset/train/67_17.wav|of course, would be the cheapest material to work with overall, like this screen protector.
dataset/train/67_18.wav|But plastic on a display wouldn't last for very long.
dataset/train/67_19.wav|Displays always get touched and are rubbing up against fabric or keys in pockets or purses.
dataset/train/67_20.wav|And luckily we can tell this Realme 8 Pro is made of glass because we start seeing scratches
dataset/train/67_21.wav|at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. We're off to a good start. This means that
dataset/train/67_22.wav|the 16 megapixel hole punch front facing selfie camera is also protected under that front glass.
dataset/train/67_23.wav|There is a small plastic grill up top, and relatively small bezels all around the edges,
dataset/train/67_24.wav|except at the bottom where it gets a little thicker.
dataset/train/67_25.wav|The sides of the phone...this is the Infinite Blue version by the way...are made from plastic.
dataset/train/67_26.wav|You can see the darker material showing through after the paint has been scraped off.
dataset/train/67_27.wav|The top of the phone is pretty empty except for the small microphone hole.
dataset/train/67_28.wav|Then down the left side we have a lot more empty space, along with the SIM card tray.
dataset/train/67_29.wav|I'll pop that out, and I gotta say that this is probably the largest SIM card tray of all time,
dataset/train/67_30.wav|with enough room for dual SIM card slots and expandable memory.
dataset/train/67_31.wav|It's impressively long. And I do promise that my camera is in focus.
dataset/train/67_32.wav|This back panel thing is just pretty trippy. It's like a holographic pile of glitter.
dataset/train/67_33.wav|And, would you look at that, a headphone jack.
dataset/train/67_34.wav|Just another example of a budget phone where you pay less and get more features than a flagship.
dataset/train/67_35.wav|When I first pulled this phone out of the box,
dataset/train/67_36.wav|I thought it was made of glass. But it turns out that's not the case. I wasn't allowed
dataset/train/67_37.wav|to play a whole lot of video games growing up. Apparently going outside and reading a book are
dataset/train/67_38.wav|more constructive and conducive to having healthy hobbies as an adult. That turned out real good.
dataset/train/67_39.wav|One game I was allowed to play though was Frogger,
dataset/train/67_40.wav|which I think matches perfectly with Realme's Dare to Leap logo on the back.
dataset/train/67_41.wav|We'll call him Craig, and he's from Chernobyl. While his is a budget phone,
dataset/train/67_42.wav|one of it's most impressive attributes is a 108 megapixel sensor
dataset/train/67_43.wav|up here in the stove top looking camera setup. The square camera bump is made from plastic,
dataset/train/67_44.wav|but the circular surface covering the 108 megapixel Samsung built sensor is made of glass.
dataset/train/67_45.wav|This camera can shoot pictures that are 12000x9000 pixels. It's not the same sensor that was used in
dataset/train/67_46.wav|the S21 Ultra though. It's got a slightly smaller footprint. Then we have the 8 megapixel ultra wide
dataset/train/67_47.wav|camera. And the 2 megapixel macro camera in the bottom corner, along with the 2 megapixel depth
dataset/train/67_48.wav|camera. Putting the clear case on the back, it looks like it sits flush with the surface of
dataset/train/67_49.wav|the camera lenses. So it's good that at least one part of this phone isn't made from plastic.
dataset/train/67_50.wav|The 108 megapixel camera isn't the only highlight either.
dataset/train/67_51.wav|There's also a huge 4,500 milliamp hour battery inside. And the whole packaging is all less than
dataset/train/67_52.wav|$300. And if you live in a really hot place, you'll be happy to know that the 6.4 inch 1080p
dataset/train/67_53.wav|AMOLED display lasts for 24 seconds under the heat from my lighter, and does recover. Although,
dataset/train/67_54.wav|if your outside temperature reaches 2000 degrees, you might have other things to worry
dataset/train/67_55.wav|about. Surprisingly, the Realme 8 Pro also has an underscreen fingerprint scanner positioned low,
dataset/train/67_56.wav|just like the OnePlus 9 Pro. I'll add some level 7 deeper groove scratches over the top of the
dataset/train/67_57.wav|optical sensor, and surprisingly again, it's still working. This $300 budget smartphone's
dataset/train/67_58.wav|fingerprint scanner beat out the $1,000 ROG Phone 5's fingerprint scanner. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/67_59.wav|Finally, the bend test. An entirely plastic phone does make me nervous,
dataset/train/67_60.wav|but structural integrity depends on how it's made just as much as what it's made from.
dataset/train/67_61.wav|Bending from the back we do get some normal flex, but the 8 Pro locks out
dataset/train/67_62.wav|and does not crack or snap. And bending from the front we get the same thing.
dataset/train/67_63.wav|A little curvature but no catastrophic damage. The Realme 8 Pro is a solid budget phone.
dataset/train/67_64.wav|I did hear one crack, but I don't see any physical damage from the outside, so we'll have to open her
dataset/train/67_65.wav|up and check on the insides. And of course, we gotta see how big that 108 megapixel Samsung
dataset/train/67_66.wav|sensor is as well. I'll be giving away Craig's two friends over on Twitter – the Illuminating Yellow,
dataset/train/67_67.wav|and the Infinite Black. So if you want one of these phones just come follow me over there.
dataset/train/67_68.wav|And I'll try not to draw frogs on them before I send them out...but no promises.
dataset/train/67_69.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/67_70.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/68_1.wav|The OnePlus 9 Pro. This is the first phone in a while that's piqued my interest,
dataset/train/68_2.wav|and it all has to do with this little guy down here. Co-developed with Hasselblad.
dataset/train/68_3.wav|Now usually I don't pay a whole lot of attention to these little joint ventures
dataset/train/68_4.wav|since I usually see them as a marketing gimmick where one brand is trying to mooch
dataset/train/68_5.wav|off the popularity of the other brand without much actual improvement to the consumer.
dataset/train/68_6.wav|But this time seems a little different. For one, OnePlus is dropping 150 million dollars over the
dataset/train/68_7.wav|next 3 years to improve their mobile cameras, and that's a big deal. And for two, Hasselblad
dataset/train/68_8.wav|is just pretty cool. One of Hasselblad's more notable ventures was with NASA and the Apollo
dataset/train/68_9.wav|missions. The cameras weren't digital back in those days, so NASA took a specially adapted
dataset/train/68_10.wav|Hasselblad camera into space, along with a roll of film that allowed for 70 pictures. Imagine taking
dataset/train/68_11.wav|only 70 pictures on the trip of a lifetime into outer space. Nowadays people take about 70 pics to
dataset/train/68_12.wav|get a decent bathroom selfie. During the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, after the cameras had
dataset/train/68_13.wav|taken their pictures, they hoisted them up the ladder, took out the film, and then tossed the
dataset/train/68_14.wav|camera bodies back behind to the moon's surface to save weight on the return trip back to earth.
dataset/train/68_15.wav|During all of the Apollo missions, a total of 12 Hasselblad camera bodies
dataset/train/68_16.wav|were just tossed out and left behind on the moon's surface. Normally we frown on
dataset/train/68_17.wav|littering, but I guess we can make an exception in extreme situations.
dataset/train/68_18.wav|Speaking of which, let's hope this OnePlus 9 Pro survives the durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/68_19.wav|Right off the bat, the most noticeable thing on this OnePlus 9 Pro is the camera bump
dataset/train/68_20.wav|with it's quad cameras. And the very noticeable Hasselblad logo across the lens. Then of course,
dataset/train/68_21.wav|we have the highly reflective glass backed panel. The coolest part of this phone is obviously going
dataset/train/68_22.wav|to be those cameras. But like usual, let's start with the screen. And once again, OnePlus has been
dataset/train/68_23.wav|nice enough to preinstall a rather nice plastic screen protector. Can't complain about that.
dataset/train/68_24.wav|As I scratch through the different levels of Mohs hardness, we're able to tell what the
dataset/train/68_25.wav|screen is made from. Plastic would scratch at a level 2 or 3. Glass would scratch at a 5 or 6.
dataset/train/68_26.wav|And a sapphire screen would scratch at an 8 or 9. Word on the street is that another sapphire
dataset/train/68_27.wav|screen phone was just released. Now I'm going to try to get my hands on one. But as we can see,
dataset/train/68_28.wav|the OnePlus 9 Pro is made with Gorilla Glass, and scratches at a level 6,
dataset/train/68_29.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7. Pretty normal.
dataset/train/68_30.wav|The front camera is a hole punch and sits in the top left corner of the phone.
dataset/train/68_31.wav|It's got 16 megapixels and is protected by that front glass.
dataset/train/68_32.wav|There is a plastic speaker grill covering the earpiece slot. This also doubles as one of the two
dataset/train/68_33.wav|stereo speakers. And the phone has pretty minimal bezels going all the way around the screen.
dataset/train/68_34.wav|One thing I do like about silver phones is that they are less prone to showing scratches
dataset/train/68_35.wav|since the metal is also silver on the inside as well.
dataset/train/68_36.wav|After seeing the ROG Phone, this antenna line makes me nervous. The power button
dataset/train/68_37.wav|and mute slider are both made from metal. I think every phone should have one of these.
dataset/train/68_38.wav|The top of the phone is pretty vacant. This is one of those noise cancelling mics up here.
dataset/train/68_39.wav|Then we have the volume rocker running down the left side...also
dataset/train/68_40.wav|made from metal. At the bottom of the OnePlus 9 Pro we have the second stereo speaker slot,
dataset/train/68_41.wav|the USB-C port, and the single SIM card tray. It does have a red rubber ring around
dataset/train/68_42.wav|the opening. The phone is officially ip68 this time around, but we'll have to check
dataset/train/68_43.wav|out the rest of the ingress points from the inside during the teardown.
dataset/train/68_44.wav|The back glass panel is super smooth this time around. No frosted glass or etching,
dataset/train/68_45.wav|just a soft smudge collecting piece of glass. If you're trying to keep your fingerprints on the
dataset/train/68_46.wav|down-low, there's always Robot Camo from dbrand. The nice thing about skins is that you can switch
dataset/train/68_47.wav|them up whenever you want, and it's like getting a totally new phone. Robot Camo is kind of fitting
dataset/train/68_48.wav|for the OnePlus 9 Pro since there are more robots than humans in space at the moment.
dataset/train/68_49.wav|I'll leave a link down in the description so you can customize your own phone.
dataset/train/68_50.wav|Let's talk a little bit more about this Hasselblad camera setup.
dataset/train/68_51.wav|I feel like smartphones in general have been doing small quirky things to stand out lately.
dataset/train/68_52.wav|But I'm hoping that OnePlus's huge investment into the mobile camera will bring some legitimate
dataset/train/68_53.wav|improvement to the space. Since this is the first phone constructed during the partnership,
dataset/train/68_54.wav|Hasselblad has contributed software improvements, color tuning, and sensor calibrations,
dataset/train/68_55.wav|but no physical hardware just yet.
dataset/train/68_56.wav|Up at the top we have a 50 megapixel ultra wide camera which does have a sensor that's 3x larger
dataset/train/68_57.wav|than the iPhone 12 Pro Max's...but who's counting. Then we have the main 48 megapixel camera which
dataset/train/68_58.wav|can do 12 bit raw images and 8K video. To put that into perspective, this camera can capture
dataset/train/68_59.wav|68 billion colors while the screen can only display 1 billion, which is crazy. The extra
dataset/train/68_60.wav|information is still utilized of course for picture editing and better quality in general,
dataset/train/68_61.wav|even if it's not visible on the screen. It's just interesting to see how far cameras have come.
dataset/train/68_62.wav|The main camera also works alongside a dedicated 2 megapixel monochrome camera down here.
dataset/train/68_63.wav|Then we have the 3x zoom 8 megapixel telephoto camera over here, with the dual colored LED flash.
dataset/train/68_64.wav|We'll talk more about the cameras when we can see them from the inside.
dataset/train/68_65.wav|Before we can get to the screen, I haven't had a lot of luck recently
dataset/train/68_66.wav|with the underscreen fingerprint scanners. They don't consistently read my fingerprints.
dataset/train/68_67.wav|So I'll get the OnePlus 9 Pro set up and give it a nice coating of level 7 deeper grooves.
dataset/train/68_68.wav|The scanning location is optical as you can see from the light that helps illuminate
dataset/train/68_69.wav|my fingerprint for the underscreen camera. It's also positioned very low on the screen,
dataset/train/68_70.wav|which is interesting. But it does still work every time, no complaints here.
dataset/train/68_71.wav|Now for the screen. The OnePlus 9 Pro is packing a 6.7 inch,
dataset/train/68_72.wav|1440p 10 bit display...meaning it's got those 1 billion colors we talked about earlier. Most cell
dataset/train/68_73.wav|phone screens do not. Plus it's got the 120 Hertz refresh rate with a touch sensitivity rate of 360,
dataset/train/68_74.wav|which is even faster than the ROG Phone 5 gaming phone. May he rest in peace.
dataset/train/68_75.wav|But the most important thing of all, and the reason you're all here
dataset/train/68_76.wav|is that the AMOLED screen can last 40 seconds under the heat from my lighter,
dataset/train/68_77.wav|which is good because that was a lot of information to communicate.
dataset/train/68_78.wav|It's a powerful flagship of a phone, and with that the 9 Pro does have a flagship of a price.
dataset/train/68_79.wav|The last thing we have left is to check the structural integrity. Rumor has it there are
dataset/train/68_80.wav|two batteries inside of this thing. And the last dual battery phone we tested didn't do so well.
dataset/train/68_81.wav|When bent from the back, this OnePlus 9 Pro does have a slight curve,
dataset/train/68_82.wav|but locks out and does not crack, kink, or break. Flipping it to the front,
dataset/train/68_83.wav|it once again locks out and stops bending. Not too shabby. My fingers are pretty happy
dataset/train/68_84.wav|there are no glass shards this time around. The OnePlus 9 Pro passes my durability test.
dataset/train/68_85.wav|I'm looking forward to seeing what this Hasselblad partnership brings to the camera space.
dataset/train/68_86.wav|If Hasselblad is creative enough to work with NASA, I'm looking forward to seeing
dataset/train/68_87.wav|what they can do with OnePlus. And when you see that Hasselblad logo,
dataset/train/68_88.wav|just remember there are 12 Hasselblad cameras just chilling on the surface of the moon,
dataset/train/68_89.wav|free for the taking. All you gotta do is go get them.
dataset/train/68_90.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/68_91.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/69_1.wav|Well, here we are with what's left of the ROG Phone 5. This top of the line gaming phone did not
dataset/train/69_2.wav|survive my durability test. The one billion color display is cracked underneath the glass, and well,
dataset/train/69_3.wav|the back glass is also broken, shattered, or I don't know, I guess obliterated might be the best
dataset/train/69_4.wav|word. Why though? ROG has made 3 other super structurally solid gaming phones in the past,
dataset/train/69_5.wav|and even the normal line up of ASUS phones has always been super solid. What made this ROG 5
dataset/train/69_6.wav|so much weaker. Today we're going to take this guy apart to see what really happened. And of course,
dataset/train/69_7.wav|we'll see how these LEDs are still working from the inside as well. Let's get started.
dataset/train/69_8.wav|Now normally I use heat to soften the adhesive under the glass so I can remove the glass without
dataset/train/69_9.wav|it breaking. I don't think it's physically possible for this glass to break any more than
dataset/train/69_10.wav|it has, but the adhesive underneath is still super strong. So I'll bring over that heat gun anyway.
dataset/train/69_11.wav|I would have to say that holding this phone is rather unpleasant.
dataset/train/69_12.wav|Immediately upon removal of the glass we get a glimpse of two free floating LED ribbons.
dataset/train/69_13.wav|These ribbons would normally be seated at the top and bottom of the panel logo,
dataset/train/69_14.wav|shining their light up into a piece of translucent white plastic. The plastic diffuses the colored
dataset/train/69_15.wav|LEDs to fill up a much larger area. Kind of the same thing we've seen in previous ROG phones.
dataset/train/69_16.wav|It's pretty cool to see it all from the inside. There are definitely two batteries in here,
dataset/train/69_17.wav|which is probably one of the reasons for our structural issues.
dataset/train/69_18.wav|I'll remove 6 screws on the bottom plastic plate. Five more screws on the middle plate.
dataset/train/69_19.wav|And 6 screws on the top plate, which also contains the top loudspeaker and earpiece. It
dataset/train/69_20.wav|does have a little chamber of sound dampening foam balls inside, which is a good thing.
dataset/train/69_21.wav|And we need all the good things we can get at this point.
dataset/train/69_22.wav|The battery connectors are not immediately visible, so I'll just start popping off ribbons
dataset/train/69_23.wav|just like little Legos. And there are quite a lot of them. I'm still not sure where the
dataset/train/69_24.wav|batteries are plugged in, but since the phone's already toast, I'm not super worried about it.
dataset/train/69_25.wav|Normally phones are built with motherboards and batteries running lengthwise inside the phone.
dataset/train/69_26.wav|And battery compartments running lengthwise usually have a tall metal ridge inside the phone
dataset/train/69_27.wav|to separate the battery from the motherboard. And that metal ridge, by default, helps give
dataset/train/69_28.wav|the phone structural rigidity and strength. But this ROG 5 has five different internal segments,
dataset/train/69_29.wav|two battery portions and three circuit board portions....which explains the
dataset/train/69_30.wav|plethora of extension ribbons. The problem is that none of these segments are running
dataset/train/69_31.wav|lengthwise inside of the phone, which means nothing internally is helping the structure.
dataset/train/69_32.wav|And also, unfortunately, right there in the middle of the frame are two super thin weak points where
dataset/train/69_33.wav|large chunks of the frame have been cut out. The antenna line and the accessories port provide the
dataset/train/69_34.wav|perfect dotted lines for the phone to fold on. And when it bends too far, the glass breaks...on both
dataset/train/69_35.wav|sides. Putting the ROG Phone 5 in a back pocket and sitting down would definitely be a no-no.
dataset/train/69_36.wav|The motherboard in the center is stacked,
dataset/train/69_37.wav|and comes with the cutest shortest little ribbon connectors we've ever seen. At this point I'm not
dataset/train/69_38.wav|super invested in trying to save the phone since it's pretty far gone. I just want to see the
dataset/train/69_39.wav|batteries and the internal vapor chamber if there is one. There are a ton of ribbon cables in here.
dataset/train/69_40.wav|If there was a price for the most ribbon cables, this phone definitely wins.
dataset/train/69_41.wav|The bottom circuit board comes out.
dataset/train/69_42.wav|This has a headphone jack soldered in place, which is weird because everything else has a ribbon. The
dataset/train/69_43.wav|bottom stereo speaker does not have little foam balls inside. And the vibrator looks pretty normal
dataset/train/69_44.wav|and unbroken, so I'm not sure why it was making those dying cat noises during the durability test.
dataset/train/69_45.wav|Asus has made the batteries very difficult to remove.
dataset/train/69_46.wav|Prying is pretty dangerous, since if the internal layers of the pouch-style
dataset/train/69_47.wav|battery were to crush together and short out, they would start on fire.
dataset/train/69_48.wav|But isopropyl alcohol does work its magic in dissolving the adhesive,
dataset/train/69_49.wav|and with a little less force I can pull it loose.
dataset/train/69_50.wav|It's still unable to be removed though since the plug is running underneath the center motherboard.
dataset/train/69_51.wav|Now, at first glance I thought the middle motherboard had a rivet through it,
dataset/train/69_52.wav|pinning it to the frame, which I just broke off because that's how done I am with this phone and
dataset/train/69_53.wav|its glass shards. But at closer glance it looks like it's actually the world's smallest hex bolt
dataset/train/69_54.wav|right below that circular head, so it probably can be removed safely,
dataset/train/69_55.wav|with little tiny pliers, or maybe asking a mouse if you can borrow a wrench.
dataset/train/69_56.wav|The top battery is also glued in place. Remember,
dataset/train/69_57.wav|this phone probably would have survived if these batteries were oriented differently.
dataset/train/69_58.wav|And there they are. Two batteries tied together with one plug.
dataset/train/69_59.wav|Each of them are 2885 milliamp hours in capacity, and each one can be charged at 30 watts,
dataset/train/69_60.wav|bringing the total charging wattage to 60. A Tesla, by comparison, can charge at 150,000
dataset/train/69_61.wav|watts since they have 6,000 batteries inside. It's cool how it scales up like that...well, cool until
dataset/train/69_62.wav|we realize that the dual battery design is what killed the phone. You win some and you lose some.
dataset/train/69_63.wav|It does look like we are in luck though with the vapor chamber. We'll have to dig that out
dataset/train/69_64.wav|after we check on the cameras. The ROG Phone 5 has 3 cameras. Once I get them out we can
dataset/train/69_65.wav|see that the 64 megapixel main sensor on the left does not have optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/69_66.wav|Then we have the 13 megapixel ultra wide camera in the middle, which also does not have OIS.
dataset/train/69_67.wav|Asus says they both have internal electronic image stabilization, but that's not quite the
dataset/train/69_68.wav|same thing. The small five megapixel macro lens also just has that EIS and not OIS.
dataset/train/69_69.wav|The front 25 megapixel camera also does not have OIS, but that's pretty normal.
dataset/train/69_70.wav|Finally, the vapor chamber. Last week we took apart the Xperia Pro, which has the largest
dataset/train/69_71.wav|vapor chamber we've ever seen in a smartphone. I sliced open my finger trying to pull this out for
dataset/train/69_72.wav|you guys...which is a fair injury I guess since, well, you saw what I did to the phone first.
dataset/train/69_73.wav|To remove the vapor chamber, once again we have to take off the screen.
dataset/train/69_74.wav|I don't feel as bad about this one since the screen is already broken.
dataset/train/69_75.wav|I can get it warmed up a bit and then slip my razor inside and slice under the glass all
dataset/train/69_76.wav|around the edge, separating the screen from the body. What I am impressed with is how the Victus
dataset/train/69_77.wav|glass has not yet shattered or cracked even one bit. The rest of the phone has been obliterated,
dataset/train/69_78.wav|but the front glass is still in one piece. Nice work, Corning.
dataset/train/69_79.wav|And we see why the fingerprint scanner is so terrible. It's the size of an ant and
dataset/train/69_80.wav|doesn't have a lens. Honestly, a lot of things in this phone don't seem planned out very well.
dataset/train/69_81.wav|It's almost like there was a pandemic last year and instead of waiting it out,
dataset/train/69_82.wav|ROG threw this guy together with a socially distant team who did the best with what they had.
dataset/train/69_83.wav|And what they had was blue thermal paste. Now it looks like I poked a Smurf.
dataset/train/69_84.wav|The vapor chamber isn't winning any size awards this year though.
dataset/train/69_85.wav|I think Sony's going to hold that record for a while. There does seem to be a little
dataset/train/69_86.wav|bit of liquid inside you can see evaporate very quickly after I slice open the copper.
dataset/train/69_87.wav|Well, this was a tough one. The ROG series gaming phones have been some of my favorites
dataset/train/69_88.wav|for a long time. And just because the ROG 5 failed the durability test, it doesn't make
dataset/train/69_89.wav|it a bad phone, it just has some weak points that potential owners should be aware of.
dataset/train/69_90.wav|Take care of it and don't sit on it. There's no need to baby it of course, just don't
dataset/train/69_91.wav|not baby it. A beefy case would solve 100% of it's structural problems and leave you with
dataset/train/69_92.wav|nothing to worry about. I'm definitely looking forward to the ROG Phone 6 next year for sure.
dataset/train/69_93.wav|As always, let me know what you think down in the comments. Hit
dataset/train/69_94.wav|that subscribe button if you haven't already. And come hang out with me on
dataset/train/69_95.wav|Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/7_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart the Pixel 7 Pro. We will dissect Google's latest phone
dataset/train/7_2.wav|to find out what's going on to make that antenna line crack during the bend test. Separation along
dataset/train/7_3.wav|the antenna line is never a good thing. You know what other lines aren't good? Lines at
dataset/train/7_4.wav|the Post Office. Huge thanks to Stamps.com for sponsoring this video. With the end of the year
dataset/train/7_5.wav|and the holidays coming up, you already know that people are going to be sending a lot more
dataset/train/7_6.wav|packages than usual. Luckily when I'm shipping things, like my JerryRigEverything Knives,
dataset/train/7_7.wav|I get to avoid the lines at the Post Office since I use Stamps.com. With only my computer
dataset/train/7_8.wav|and printer I can print postage right from home that's massively discounted for both UPS and USPS,
dataset/train/7_9.wav|up to 86% off. No lines, no traffic, no hassle. Plus you get a 4-week trial,
dataset/train/7_10.wav|free postage, and free 5 pound digital scale at Stamps.com/JerryRig. No long term commitments
dataset/train/7_11.wav|or contracts, just how we like it. You can schedule pickups, compare carriers and rates,
dataset/train/7_12.wav|and if you run an online store, Stamps.com integrates seamlessly with all major shopping
dataset/train/7_13.wav|carts and marketplaces. But don't take my word for it. They've been around for over 20 years
dataset/train/7_14.wav|and helped over 1 million businesses. This holiday season you can trade late nights for
dataset/train/7_15.wav|silent nights at Stamps.com/JerryRig. Now that we've solved the long lines at the Post Office,
dataset/train/7_16.wav|let's see what's going on with the antenna lines on the Pixel 7 Pro. Let's get started.
dataset/train/7_17.wav|Here we are with the Pixel 7 Pro – looking very similar to the Pixel 6 Pro except for that this
dataset/train/7_18.wav|time we have the metal, scratchable camera visor. I'm a pretty big fan of the Pixel phones from a
dataset/train/7_19.wav|repairability standpoint. They are usually one of the more repairable phones we come across.
dataset/train/7_20.wav|And if the layout is anything like last year, we'll be starting the teardown from
dataset/train/7_21.wav|the screen side with lots and lots of heat. The reason for heat is because the screen is very
dataset/train/7_22.wav|securely glued to the frame of the phone. The glue works as part of the structure as well as
dataset/train/7_23.wav|helping keep water out. With a strong suction cup and sharp razor though, we can start to see
dataset/train/7_24.wav|some separation. However, this is where I made my first mistake. During my initial incision,
dataset/train/7_25.wav|the incursion failed to fully penetrate all of the layers. Instead of filleting the screen as
dataset/train/7_26.wav|a whole, my razor separated the glass from its protective plastic border, you know,
dataset/train/7_27.wav|two layers which should not be separated. Last year's Pixel 6 Pro also had this plastic border
dataset/train/7_28.wav|around the glass so I should have been prepared for it, but here we still are.
dataset/train/7_29.wav|The display is unlikely to survive without that plastic protection. And yeah,
dataset/train/7_30.wav|we have indeed damaged the screen. An unfortunate occurrence for sure,
dataset/train/7_31.wav|but since my mistake can also be used as an example of what not to do, the death of my
dataset/train/7_32.wav|phone can help prevent others from also dying, so I'll still consider it a win.
dataset/train/7_33.wav|Let's go deeper. Google has gotten rid of the little screw that held down the screen ribbon
dataset/train/7_34.wav|bracket. We just have a little latch instead, meaning that this whole screen repair procedure
dataset/train/7_35.wav|could indeed be done without any tools besides just a hot plate and a separator.
dataset/train/7_36.wav|Pretty nice. The screen still has the optical fingerprint scanner attached,
dataset/train/7_37.wav|but Google does provide online tools to sync a new scanner with your phone
dataset/train/7_38.wav|after repairs are made, so it's not that big of a deal when it comes to repairs.
dataset/train/7_39.wav|Next to the hole punch camera we have a translucent portion of the screen. This
dataset/train/7_40.wav|is for the light and proximity sensors. Inside the Pixel 7 Pro there is quite a bit of graphite
dataset/train/7_41.wav|tape which is probably to help transfer the heat out of the phone through the screen.
dataset/train/7_42.wav|Once the graphite tape is gone we get access to our 8 T4 screws that hold down the midplate. While
dataset/train/7_43.wav|very similar in design to last year's Pixel 6 Pro, the shape of the midplate this time is
dataset/train/7_44.wav|different. The blade in the 6 Pro extended up above the camera visor line while this
dataset/train/7_45.wav|metal mid plate does not. It stops right at the first camera bump edge, making the camera bump
dataset/train/7_46.wav|and the corresponding plastic antenna line the weakest point of the phone. The metal midplate
dataset/train/7_47.wav|does have two water damage indicators, and it's also super rigid, non flexing,
dataset/train/7_48.wav|and super brittle. Either it's not really metal or the vegetable I ate last week is really paying
dataset/train/7_49.wav|off. When the plate's screwed down into the phone, it probably does provide quite a bit of structure
dataset/train/7_50.wav|though. If Google had extended this plate upward a tad farther to help support the antenna line area,
dataset/train/7_51.wav|maybe the phone wouldn't have bent as much and our water protection might still be intact.
dataset/train/7_52.wav|With the midplate gone I can unplug the battery just like a little Lego,
dataset/train/7_53.wav|and we find the same plastic style pull strap under the battery that we
dataset/train/7_54.wav|saw last year. Now it would be nice if we could turn this strap into a saw and cut
dataset/train/7_55.wav|through the adhesive under each end of the battery just like how bakers use thread or
dataset/train/7_56.wav|dental floss to make cinnamon rolls. But as you can tell this doesn't really work,
dataset/train/7_57.wav|and the strap itself isn't strong enough to lift the battery out on its own. I imagine Google wants
dataset/train/7_58.wav|their technicians to drift some isopropyl alcohol under here and then use the strap, which is fine.
dataset/train/7_59.wav|It does work and Google's battery is still only about half as glued in as Samsung's batteries.
dataset/train/7_60.wav|Less glue is a good thing. With all 5,000 milliamp hours taken out from the phone, we get our first
dataset/train/7_61.wav|look at the metal mill markings on the inner battery tray. Very similar to the mill markings
dataset/train/7_62.wav|left behind by our own tormach that makes our Not A Wheelchair prototype gear housings. The markings
dataset/train/7_63.wav|in the phone are just much smaller. To get access to the camera unit I'll unplug all the little
dataset/train/7_64.wav|ribbon cable connections and then remove three more T4 screws holding down the massive metal
dataset/train/7_65.wav|camera housing into the massive metal exterior camera bump. It's like a nesting doll for nerds.
dataset/train/7_66.wav|We have the large 50 megapixel main camera with OIS on the side. A 12 megapixel ultra
dataset/train/7_67.wav|wide camera in the center with no OIS. And apparently, Google says that their 48 megapixel
dataset/train/7_68.wav|telephoto camera with the 5x optical zoom does have optical image stabilization as well.
dataset/train/7_69.wav|But we can only check on that from the inside. There are three kinds of camera stabilization:
dataset/train/7_70.wav|optical where the lens is visible shifted around using magnets to stabilize the incoming light.
dataset/train/7_71.wav|Then we have sensor shift which is what Apple uses to visibly move the sensor under the lens
dataset/train/7_72.wav|to stabilize an image. And then we have EIS, or electronic image stabilization, that happens after
dataset/train/7_73.wav|light has hit the sensor, all in the software. Any, and/or all of these can be combined to work
dataset/train/7_74.wav|together at the same time. So if we take a look at the periscoping lens components from the inside,
dataset/train/7_75.wav|we can see on the left we have our periscope. In the center we have our zoom-in focus,
dataset/train/7_76.wav|and on the far end, perpendicular to the back of the phone, we have our camera sensor.
dataset/train/7_77.wav|Looking for the optical stabilization since there doesn't appear to be much movement,
dataset/train/7_78.wav|we do see copper electromagnetic coils positioned along each of the moving parts so the OIS does
dataset/train/7_79.wav|indeed exist, it's just very minor when compared to the wide angle camera. Hopefully those small
dataset/train/7_80.wav|movements are all we need with the telephoto lens. I'll leave those comparisons for other reviewers.
dataset/train/7_81.wav|The motherboard is coming out next, whether it wants to or not. Three more T4 screws get taken
dataset/train/7_82.wav|out and some wires popped off. And then we get a close-up look at the cute dollop of thermal
dataset/train/7_83.wav|paste that's pressed against the midplate, along with the soldered 23 watt USB-C port with its
dataset/train/7_84.wav|vibrant blue rubber ring around the opening. I think the whole phone should be that color
dataset/train/7_85.wav|next time. We also have the heftiest guiding pin I've ever seen in a smartphone. Usually we
dataset/train/7_86.wav|see large pins and vehicle transmissions or gear housings to guide the halves of a unit together,
dataset/train/7_87.wav|but Google over here spearing the motherboard into place with a gigantic obelisk is rather creative.
dataset/train/7_88.wav|The loudspeaker does have balls inside. Remember, these foam
dataset/train/7_89.wav|balls make the speaker sound bigger than it actually is. Instead of a gymnasium reverb,
dataset/train/7_90.wav|it helps provide more of a sound booth quality audio output, on a very tiny scale of course. It
dataset/train/7_91.wav|also has the waterproofing mesh and red rubber ring around the opening. The upper earpiece
dataset/train/7_92.wav|speaker is the same way. It's next to the 10.8 megapixel selfie camera glued and screwed in.
dataset/train/7_93.wav|It also has the red rubber rings, waterproofing, and balls of its own on top. Which means that
dataset/train/7_94.wav|the stereo sound quality of the Pixel 7 Pro should be pretty good.
dataset/train/7_95.wav|And finally, after a long and perilous journey, just like the one Frodo made to Mordor,
dataset/train/7_96.wav|we have finally reached the wireless copper rings at the back of the phone.
dataset/train/7_97.wav|And just like Frodo could have, you know, avoided the danger just by taking the eagles, you too can
dataset/train/7_98.wav|avoid the dangers of a teardown just by installing one of my Teardown Skins. Reaching the copper at
dataset/train/7_99.wav|the back with all of the joy and none of the peril, and best of all, no one needs to lose a
dataset/train/7_100.wav|finger. I'll leave a link for you down in the description. I mean, I don't have super high
dataset/train/7_101.wav|hopes that the Pixel 7 Pro is going to magically start working again once everything is put back
dataset/train/7_102.wav|together, but let's put everything back together and hope something magically starts working again.
dataset/train/7_103.wav|It's been an interesting phone. We found out why there's a structural weakness along the antenna
dataset/train/7_104.wav|line. And the telephoto optical stabilization hardware is pretty nifty. Electromagnetic
dataset/train/7_105.wav|smartphone OIS is a great icebreaker at parties. And finally, of course, we learned that the screen
dataset/train/7_106.wav|should definitely be removed with their protective plastics still intact, because when they're
dataset/train/7_107.wav|separated the screen does seem to die, even if the phone itself is still alive and active underneath.
dataset/train/7_108.wav|Oh wait, what's this? We have life. As you can clearly see, the screen is very visibly lit
dataset/train/7_109.wav|up and operational. You can see it with your own eyes. Haters will say it's photoshopped,
dataset/train/7_110.wav|but it's most definitely another successful teardown here at JerryRig. Hit that subscribe
dataset/train/7_111.wav|button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter,
dataset/train/7_112.wav|if it still exists. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/70_1.wav|The ROG Phone 5 is basically the most powerful gaming phone on the market right now,
dataset/train/70_2.wav|and could be argued that it's the most powerful smartphone of all time.
dataset/train/70_3.wav|I kind of sliced my finger open removing the massive heat pipe on the Xperia Pro,
dataset/train/70_4.wav|so I apologize for that. But it will be relevant a little later in this video.
dataset/train/70_5.wav|Inside the box our ROG Phone, the Republic of Gamers, comes with an external cooling fan.
dataset/train/70_6.wav|This time around it's got the RGB lights on the bottom with two extra clicky buttons on either
dataset/train/70_7.wav|side of the fan. Moving two gaming buttons to the back saves screen real estate for your eyes. It's
dataset/train/70_8.wav|kind of smart now the display is not covered up by fingers. This guy costs about 1,000 euros,
dataset/train/70_9.wav|which is $1,200, so it should be an interesting durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/70_10.wav|Right off the bat this phone is pretty dark, black everywhere, with some futuristic text
dataset/train/70_11.wav|and LED designs on the back. If you remember, ROG has always been kind of loud with their designs.
dataset/train/70_12.wav|The ROG 1 and 2 both had big metal buttons on the back with builtin vents that were supposed to help
dataset/train/70_13.wav|dissipate the heat from inside the phone. Then the ROG 3 came along with its more subtle design,
dataset/train/70_14.wav|but still had that massive metal aerodynamic cooling system inside for the heat dissipation,
dataset/train/70_15.wav|which was also visible from outside the phone with a little transparent window.
dataset/train/70_16.wav|I was a big fan of this one. All of these phones have been pretty rock solid so far.
dataset/train/70_17.wav|ROG did skip the number 4, which is common because in China the number 4 is an unlucky number...just
dataset/train/70_18.wav|like 13 is unlucky here in the USA. Their number 4 sounds very similar to the word “death”,
dataset/train/70_19.wav|so it's just better to skip it since nobody wants an ROG phone called Death.
dataset/train/70_20.wav|The ROG 5 design is much more subtle, almost falling into
dataset/train/70_21.wav|that normal boring glass rectangle thing that every other phone brand is doing,
dataset/train/70_22.wav|so it's a little disappointing. I still prefer the loud aesthetic of the previous versions.
dataset/train/70_23.wav|Also inside the box we get some stickers and a very thin plastic case.
dataset/train/70_24.wav|We also get a large 60 watt fast charger since there are 2 batteries inside the ROG Phone 5.
dataset/train/70_25.wav|It can charge twice as fast. There's also a braided cable. If you do want a backup, or
dataset/train/70_26.wav|travel charger that's about one fourth the size of this brick, you can always grab a 20 watt charger
dataset/train/70_27.wav|from my channel's sponsor Anker. It's just $16 on Amazon. I'll leave a link in the description.
dataset/train/70_28.wav|It's time for the scratch test. I've been systematically durability testing smartphones
dataset/train/70_29.wav|for the past 6 years. It's a strange hobby, I know. But performing the same tests over
dataset/train/70_30.wav|and over again let's us compare all of the popular phones to each other over the years,
dataset/train/70_31.wav|and luckily the vast majority of the phones that I test survive.
dataset/train/70_32.wav|It's pretty rare when a phone fails. The ROG 5 is using Gorilla Glass Victus, and we start seeing
dataset/train/70_33.wav|scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. Everything's pretty normal so far.
dataset/train/70_34.wav|There is a thin earpiece slot up at the top of the phone
dataset/train/70_35.wav|for the top stereo speaker. And then there's the front facing 24 megapixel camera
dataset/train/70_36.wav|that's also tucked up here into the bezel. The bezels aren't crazy big, and for a gaming phone
dataset/train/70_37.wav|it's actually kind of nice since the phone is normally in the horizontal position, and
dataset/train/70_38.wav|the bezels give your hand a little bit more real estate to hold onto without covering the screen.
dataset/train/70_39.wav|Speaking of real estate, there are additional capacitive buttons on the side corners of
dataset/train/70_40.wav|the phone, along with the metal power button, and the metal volume rocker.
dataset/train/70_41.wav|These capacitive triggers can be programmed to different actions while gaming.
dataset/train/70_42.wav|The top of the phone is pretty bare. And over here on the left side of the phone we get more metal,
dataset/train/70_43.wav|along with the rubber stopper that is most definitely going to get lost.
dataset/train/70_44.wav|There's a zero percent chance this thing lasts longer than a week.
dataset/train/70_45.wav|We'll come back to these ports in a second. The second SIM card tray is also metal,
dataset/train/70_46.wav|and funny enough, a normal size SIM card removal tool isn't long enough to open it up.
dataset/train/70_47.wav|You'll need an extra long tool to get the job done. Also, strangely, there is no rubber ring
dataset/train/70_48.wav|around the SIM card tray opening which is usually like the bare minimum of water resistance.
dataset/train/70_49.wav|The ROG Phone 5 has no official IP rating, which means even ROG doesn't trust their rubber plug.
dataset/train/70_50.wav|The bottom of the phone has another USB-C port, as well as a headphone jack. I'm glad it's back since
dataset/train/70_51.wav|it disappeared on last year's model. Now, it's pretty cool of Asus to include a fan in the box.
dataset/train/70_52.wav|I'm still skeptical that blowing air on the surface of the phone on the outside of the glass
dataset/train/70_53.wav|has any meaningful impact on the internal temperatures, but Asus says that the fan,
dataset/train/70_54.wav|which also has a kickstand, increases the surface temperature by 15 degrees, and
dataset/train/70_55.wav|the internal processor by 10. I'll have to test that out later, you know, if the phone survives.
dataset/train/70_56.wav|Jumping into the settings we can change up the exterior lighting
dataset/train/70_57.wav|since we know that the RGBs improve the FPSs of the ROGs. I'll bump the fan to full blast
dataset/train/70_58.wav|so you can get a feel for how loud it is. And then I'll drop it down to minimum.
dataset/train/70_59.wav|Nothing super crazy. My favorite active cooling system that we've ever seen
dataset/train/70_60.wav|is still the thermoelectric cooler on the Black Shark 3.
dataset/train/70_61.wav|That thing drops the temperature to just above freezing, and was pretty impressive.
dataset/train/70_62.wav|I'll be cool to see how these lights work from the inside during the teardown.
dataset/train/70_63.wav|Unlike the ROG 1 and the ROG 2, the surface of the ROG 5 is totally flat, made out of one solid slab
dataset/train/70_64.wav|of glass. The rear camera lens is also pretty low profile. There are 3 cameras underneath,
dataset/train/70_65.wav|a 64 megapixel main camera that can film in 8K, a 13 megapixel ultra wide camera, and a
dataset/train/70_66.wav|5 megapixel macro camera, along with a single colored LED flash, all protected under glass.
dataset/train/70_67.wav|Now fingerprint scanners and I don't always have the best luck together. The ROG 5 does
dataset/train/70_68.wav|have an under display scanner – it's optical. But unfortunately, it doesn't seem to want to
dataset/train/70_69.wav|read my fingerprint very much. Granted, there are a few level 7 scratches already over the top
dataset/train/70_70.wav|and my fingers are not pristine. But for 1,000 euros, I was kind of hoping for a
dataset/train/70_71.wav|little better performance, since, you know, gaming phones are all about performance.
dataset/train/70_72.wav|The screen of the ROG 5 is where things start to really shine. We have a 6.7 inch display with 1
dataset/train/70_73.wav|billion colors. A 144 hertz refresh rate, and a 300 hertz input touch sensitivity rate, which
dataset/train/70_74.wav|is a pretty big deal while gaming. It basically means you'll be fired. Actual fire, of course,
dataset/train/70_75.wav|is probably frowned upon, but it's good to know that the AMOLED display can last for 30 seconds
dataset/train/70_76.wav|under my flame and still completely recover, minus the oleophobic coating of course. See,
dataset/train/70_77.wav|look at this. I've already forgotten about the rubber stopper and it's only been like 7 minutes.
dataset/train/70_78.wav|And I don't know about you, but when I think of gamer,
dataset/train/70_79.wav|I think of some pretty aggressive hand movements because emotions are usually high,
dataset/train/70_80.wav|which means that a gaming phone should be even more durable than a regular phone.
dataset/train/70_81.wav|And keep in mind, during this bend test that I'm not even using all of my fingers right now.
dataset/train/70_82.wav|Unfortunately, with the very first bend we see some pretty major cracking along the antenna
dataset/train/70_83.wav|line near the bottom half of the phone. And that small crack, for some reason, has catastrophically
dataset/train/70_84.wav|affected the internal vibrator, which now sounds more like a hissing cat than anything else.
dataset/train/70_85.wav|With another bend from the front we lose the entire screen
dataset/train/70_86.wav|at that same weak point – that antenna line. The Victus glass in the front is still intact,
dataset/train/70_87.wav|it's just the display under the glass that has given up the ghost. One billion colors
dataset/train/70_88.wav|are gone in an instant. This of course is not an ideal situation. A phone without a screen is
dataset/train/70_89.wav|like a car without tires. Finally, we'll flip the phone around to the back and try one more time.
dataset/train/70_90.wav|And right there next to the center USB-C and accessory port, we find another weak
dataset/train/70_91.wav|point in the frame. And just like Apple's iPad, it's game over for the ROG Phone 5.
dataset/train/70_92.wav|May he rest in piece...s. I've performed this same test on hundreds of phones over the last 6 years
dataset/train/70_93.wav|and the vast majority of them survive, which makes it even more embarrassing for the phones who
dataset/train/70_94.wav|don't, especially when they cost this much. The LED lights on the back of the phone still work,
dataset/train/70_95.wav|but the rest of the phone does not. And it's even more sad since I haven't been to the gym in a year
dataset/train/70_96.wav|and I'm only using 9 fingers. ROG skipped number 4 because they were superstitious about death,
dataset/train/70_97.wav|but then number 5 died anyway....pretty painfully.
dataset/train/70_98.wav|It'll be interesting to take this guy apart and see why it failed from the inside.
dataset/train/70_99.wav|There's a good chance that that dual battery system messed with the structural integrity.
dataset/train/70_100.wav|This is just the regular ROG 5, of course. There is one more even more expensive ROG 5
dataset/train/70_101.wav|called Ultimate, which has the second display on the back. But judging by the fact that it
dataset/train/70_102.wav|also has dual batteries, side accessory ports, and this very same antenna line on the side,
dataset/train/70_103.wav|I think it would indeed suffer the exact same fate during the bend test.
dataset/train/70_104.wav|But hit that like button if you think we should check.
dataset/train/70_105.wav|Remember, most smartphones don't hold their value all that well. So if you do want a good gaming
dataset/train/70_106.wav|phone, last year's ROG 3 still has 5G and almost the same specs, and is now half the price. And,
dataset/train/70_107.wav|more importantly, it doesn't fold in half. ROG has definitely made some winners in the past,
dataset/train/70_108.wav|just not this time around. The ROG Phone 5 officially fails my durability test.
dataset/train/70_109.wav|As always, let me know what you think down in the comments. Make sure you're
dataset/train/70_110.wav|subscribed so you don't miss that teardown. And come hang out with
dataset/train/70_111.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/71_1.wav|Today we're going to find out what makes this Sony Xperia Pro tick from the inside. At $2,500,
dataset/train/71_2.wav|it's a very specific phone for a very specific group of professionals. It's mostly made out
dataset/train/71_3.wav|of a rugged plastic. It has a vibrator that sounds like an old school 90's flip phone.
dataset/train/71_4.wav|But luckily, this guy also has a headphone jack. So corded headphones are an option.
dataset/train/71_5.wav|But there are a lot of times where wireless headphones are just better...like exercising,
dataset/train/71_6.wav|or listening to a podcast or audio book when you're across the room. Huge thanks to Raycon
dataset/train/71_7.wav|for sponsoring this video. Raycon is a company dedicated to designing premium wireless audio
dataset/train/71_8.wav|for half the price of other brands, with a real focus on customer experience.
dataset/train/71_9.wav|Raycon is so confident that you'll like their earbuds, they have a 45 day free return policy,
dataset/train/71_10.wav|which is impressive. There are multiple colors to choose from. The company was co-founded by Ray J,
dataset/train/71_11.wav|and endorsed by a lot of celebrities like Snoop Dog and Mike Tyson.
dataset/train/71_12.wav|The Raycon's E25 have 6 hours of play time, and an extra 24 hours of battery inside
dataset/train/71_13.wav|that carrying case. I always use my wireless headphones on the treadmill because one time
dataset/train/71_14.wav|a long time ago I was running and my hand hit the cord of my plugged in headphones
dataset/train/71_15.wav|and caused my phone to fly across the gym, so I knew it was time to switch things up.
dataset/train/71_16.wav|Wireless is just safer for my phone. And with how small these Raycons are, they'll have no problem
dataset/train/71_17.wav|staying in my ears. I'll leave a link for these down in the video description
dataset/train/71_18.wav|with a bonus 15% off coupon code for you guys. Just head to buyraycon.com/jerryrigeverything.
dataset/train/71_19.wav|And huge thanks again to Raycon for sponsoring this video and supporting the channel.
dataset/train/71_20.wav|Now it's time to see what's inside the world's only real professional
dataset/train/71_21.wav|smartphone – the Xperia Pro. Let's get started.
dataset/train/71_22.wav|The Xperia Pro has branded itself as so professional that we expect the insides to be all
dataset/train/71_23.wav|down to business as well...but that's not exactly the case. Already, taking off the back panel is
dataset/train/71_24.wav|rather unique. Normally with glass phones I try to be super careful, since glass is glass, and glass
dataset/train/71_25.wav|breaks. But this phone is plastic, and although we can see the heavy duty waterproofing adhesive
dataset/train/71_26.wav|holding the whole thing together, the back panel can still be removed fairly easily without any
dataset/train/71_27.wav|heat. Of course, this does kill the factory water resistance. I do like plastic phones though
dataset/train/71_28.wav|since it's a big part of the phone that will never break or shatter.
dataset/train/71_29.wav|Once the back panel is off we can see the little NFC copper coil.
dataset/train/71_30.wav|There is no wireless charging, and the only piece of glass back here
dataset/train/71_31.wav|to be found is on the camera lens, and that gets removed with the back panel.
dataset/train/71_32.wav|One interesting thing Sony has done is that they've colored all of their screws with a soft
dataset/train/71_33.wav|pastel anodizing, something we've literally never seen, ever, inside of a cell phone.
dataset/train/71_34.wav|It's kind of like a Easter egg hunt up in here. It's got soft purple screws,
dataset/train/71_35.wav|blue screws, and even some greenish/yellow screws. Kind of cute. One thing I was curious about are
dataset/train/71_36.wav|all these graphite pads on the back. It took me a second to realize what they're for. Graphite
dataset/train/71_37.wav|pads are embracing the inner back metal panel. Kind of like a warm hug. We all like warm hugs.
dataset/train/71_38.wav|But before I show you what they're used for, I'll remove the bottom L-shaped metal bracket,
dataset/train/71_39.wav|then another black plastic bracket up here on the top right. And then the large metal panel
dataset/train/71_40.wav|can come away from the inside of the phone revealing that each of those graphite pads
dataset/train/71_41.wav|are connected to the 5G antennas – one for each side of the phone. The graphite helps wick the
dataset/train/71_42.wav|heat away from the antennas when they are working hard professionally, transferring the professional
dataset/train/71_43.wav|camera footage over the Internets during professional live streams. It's a tough task.
dataset/train/71_44.wav|The metal plate is a good spot to dissipate all of that heat. Most 5G phones we've taken apart
dataset/train/71_45.wav|so far have been made of metal and metal is just naturally good at getting rid of heat. But since
dataset/train/71_46.wav|this phone is plastic, the 5G antennas need a little extra help staying cool. Well, so far we
dataset/train/71_47.wav|have warm hugs, and more color than a quinceanera. Let's see what else this Xperia Pro has to offer.
dataset/train/71_48.wav|With the battery disconnected, just like a little Lego, and another bracket removed around that
dataset/train/71_49.wav|camera lens, I'll unclip each of the 5G antennas and we can get a close up look at this guy. These
dataset/train/71_50.wav|do the super high-speed millimeter wave stuff, you know, the frequency of 5G usually only found in
dataset/train/71_51.wav|large cities. I'll unclip the golden power button ribbon and the extension ribbon that connects
dataset/train/71_52.wav|the motherboard and bottom board. Speaking of which, the motherboard has 3 screws of its own,
dataset/train/71_53.wav|some wire ribbons, and then, of course, the expandable memory and SIM card tray.
dataset/train/71_54.wav|Then yet another small metal bracket can come loose, and we can pull out the front
dataset/train/71_55.wav|8 megapixel camera from the phone body. It's encased in white plastic. Then, of course,
dataset/train/71_56.wav|we have our good friend the headphone jack up here in the top corner as well.
dataset/train/71_57.wav|Finally, we get the motherboard out. There is a little resistance because of the way
dataset/train/71_58.wav|the microphone is waterproof with adhesive holding it to the top left corner. It's a double
dataset/train/71_59.wav|stacked motherboard like we've seen in other phones, like the newer iPhones and Samsungs.
dataset/train/71_60.wav|And it's got yet another metal bracket holding the camera connectors in place.
dataset/train/71_61.wav|Sony uses more brackets and random pieces of metal inside their phones
dataset/train/71_62.wav|more than any other manufacturer. They must really like puzzles over there. Once the cameras
dataset/train/71_63.wav|are separated from the motherboard, we can check for the optical image stabilization. The top 12
dataset/train/71_64.wav|megapixel ultra wide camera does not have OIS. The 12 megapixel telephoto lens does have OIS.
dataset/train/71_65.wav|And the bottom 12 megapixel main camera also has that OIS. Then of course, the time of flight
dataset/train/71_66.wav|camera is just over there doing its 3D depth sensing stuff. I'll get the cameras put back into
dataset/train/71_67.wav|the motherboard since I've only got enough brain cells to keep track of half of these brackets.
dataset/train/71_68.wav|I'll try to keep them organized. With the motherboard gone, we get a glimpse of what looks
dataset/train/71_69.wav|like a very large vapor chamber underneath the screen which we just might have to take a look at.
dataset/train/71_70.wav|But first, the battery. Sony has put a very large 4,000 milliamp
dataset/train/71_71.wav|hour battery inside of the Xperia Pro. At first I thought it was glued down solid.
dataset/train/71_72.wav|You can see it's very much secured to the phone body. But Sony, being the brilliant forward
dataset/train/71_73.wav|thinking, environmentally conscious recycling enablers that they are, added magic pull tabs.
dataset/train/71_74.wav|It's much easier to recycle a phone when you can safely remove the parts that go boom.
dataset/train/71_75.wav|And now that the battery is very much freed from the confines of its housing,
dataset/train/71_76.wav|it's 4,000 milliamp hours and 15.4 watt hours.
dataset/train/71_77.wav|Moving down towards the bottom of the phone. Looks like we have some more, yeah you guessed it,
dataset/train/71_78.wav|brackets. We still have yet to find the vibrator. And judging by the vibrations we felt from the
dataset/train/71_79.wav|outside of the phone, it's really really small. Once we get the board lifted off, there it is,
dataset/train/71_80.wav|schooched over into the far left corner. I'll pull off the brackets over the USB-C port and remove
dataset/train/71_81.wav|the bottom 5G antenna, then the small loudspeaker can come loose. This also has the waterproofing
dataset/train/71_82.wav|screen over the speaker opening. Remember, this phone is IP65/IP68 water resistance.
dataset/train/71_83.wav|It has two ratings. The IP65 is a test with water jets at 4psi from 10 feet away,
dataset/train/71_84.wav|which is like rain. Then the IP68 is full submersion at one and a half meters,
dataset/train/71_85.wav|which of course would require all of the flaps on the phone to be closed in order to survive.
dataset/train/71_86.wav|Finally, we get our fingers on the vibrator. This skittle sized dollop of circular metal has the
dataset/train/71_87.wav|force of like 5 ants at full gallop, or the soft putter of butterfly wings. I can't even seem to
dataset/train/71_88.wav|hold it, it's so small. Let's just say that like zero percent of the Xperia Pro's $2,500 price tag
dataset/train/71_89.wav|went into designing and paying for the vibrator. I mean, don't get me wrong, Sony was probably just
dataset/train/71_90.wav|too busy doing all the other cool stuff with the phone, like adding an HDMI port and teasing us
dataset/train/71_91.wav|with some epic thermal cooling under the display that we can't even get a really good look at. It's
dataset/train/71_92.wav|quite the internal struggle over here. Do we break what's probably the world's nicest 4K smartphone
dataset/train/71_93.wav|screen just so we can see the cooling? Or do we spend the next hour trying to reassemble the 50
dataset/train/71_94.wav|brackets and colorful screws that hold this whole thing together and just miss out on possibly the
dataset/train/71_95.wav|largest vapor chamber of all time. The correct answer is always “let's do it for science.”
dataset/train/71_96.wav|The heat gun will help soften the adhesive under the display and make things a little easier.
dataset/train/71_97.wav|But like with all glued to the frame smartphone displays, there is a zero percent chance that the
dataset/train/71_98.wav|screen survives removal. And trust me, this is just as painful for me as it is for you.
dataset/train/71_99.wav|But, take a look at that vapor chamber. This guy is bigger than any gaming phone
dataset/train/71_100.wav|we've ever come across. Personally, I think Sony does have to overcompensate a little
dataset/train/71_101.wav|since the phone frame is plastic and not doing any help removing heat. This internal vapor chamber is
dataset/train/71_102.wav|doing 100% of the thermal work and pushing the heat out through the screen. You can even see
dataset/train/71_103.wav|a little ingress point at the bottom of the vapor chamber where liquid was probably injected inside
dataset/train/71_104.wav|before it was sealed shut. And these little golf ball style divots over the top give it
dataset/train/71_105.wav|even more surface area to dissipate that heat, just like the fans on a CPU heat sink. Once I
dataset/train/71_106.wav|stab it to check for liquid, we do have to be pretty quick since it's a minute amount,
dataset/train/71_107.wav|and once exposed to the outside air, the liquid can evaporate pretty quick.
dataset/train/71_108.wav|The vents you see inside used to wick that cooling around
dataset/train/71_109.wav|inside the sealed vapor chamber as it heats up and cools down.
dataset/train/71_110.wav|And there it is, a whole lot of liquid evaporating, along with any hopes that this
dataset/train/71_111.wav|phone screen can be operational again. Replacement parts for Sony phones are pretty hard to find. I
dataset/train/71_112.wav|don't think they sell a whole lot, so there isn't a whole lot of extras to go around.
dataset/train/71_113.wav|Usually repairing Sony phones involves finding two broken phones that are the same model and
dataset/train/71_114.wav|frankensteining them together to make one working phone. But I'll keep my eyes open so
dataset/train/71_115.wav|I can get this one repaired and back to working order again. I think seeing that vapor chamber
dataset/train/71_116.wav|was worth it. Sony now holds the record for the largest internal cooling system, and they aren't
dataset/train/71_117.wav|even a gaming phone. But like always, let me know what you think down in the comments.
dataset/train/71_118.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/71_119.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/72_1.wav|The phone in front of us today costs a whopping $2,500. The Sony Xperia Pro.
dataset/train/72_2.wav|No extra numbers, no really long name, just a really long price tag.
dataset/train/72_3.wav|This might very well be the only real professional phone in existence.
dataset/train/72_4.wav|And for that price it better be. Inside the box we get a USB-C cable, 18 watt charging brick,
dataset/train/72_5.wav|and some corded headphones that have a headphone jack. That right there might be worth $2,000 to
dataset/train/72_6.wav|some people. It's always a little annoying when the charging cable that's included with the box
dataset/train/72_7.wav|is the short and stubby little guy that can barely reach anything. Personally, for the last 3 years
dataset/train/72_8.wav|I've been using one of these super long 6 foot USB-C cables next to my bed from my channel's
dataset/train/72_9.wav|sponsor Anker And it's pretty amazing. Right now you can get 2 of these super long 6 foot
dataset/train/72_10.wav|USB-C cables with a lifetime warranty for just $15 at the link in the description. I'm not sure if
dataset/train/72_11.wav|that price is a typo or not, but you might want to jump on it before Anker notices what they've done.
dataset/train/72_12.wav|At $2,500, this is one of the most expensive phones we've ever tested here on Jerry Rig
dataset/train/72_13.wav|Everything. It's definitely a professional price tag. And while I am indeed a professional,
dataset/train/72_14.wav|I don't think I'm quite the type of professional this phone was built for. Let's get started.
dataset/train/72_15.wav|Right off the bat the first thing I notice about this phone is that it feels and looks like it's
dataset/train/72_16.wav|sitting inside of a built in protective case. It's got a lightweight textured plastic exterior. The
dataset/train/72_17.wav|second thing I noticed is the screen. This is one of the only phones in existence with a 4K
dataset/train/72_18.wav|resolution display, which is pretty awesome. I'm able to see these tiny footprints in the snow,
dataset/train/72_19.wav|or the detail on the trees without the pixels getting in the way.
dataset/train/72_20.wav|That's pretty incredible. The Xperia Pro display is 40% more detailed than an iPhone 12 Pro screen.
dataset/train/72_21.wav|With a screen that's nice, it would be a real shame if someone scratched it,
dataset/train/72_22.wav|but I'll take one for the team. If you listen really closely,
dataset/train/72_23.wav|you can also hear that there's no camera bump on the back.
dataset/train/72_24.wav|The Xperia Pro is primarily designed to be a second monitor for the Sony DSLR camera,
dataset/train/72_25.wav|while at the same time using its 5G internal antennas to live stream or upload the high quality
dataset/train/72_26.wav|imagery to the Internets – which is a unique combination of characteristics. We'll talk about
dataset/train/72_27.wav|that more in a second, but the important thing is that the Gorilla Glass 6 scratches at a level 6,
dataset/train/72_28.wav|with deeper grooves at a level 7. The display is also super long, with its 21x9 aspect ratio.
dataset/train/72_29.wav|And up here at the very top it has an 8 megapixel selfie camera tucked into the
dataset/train/72_30.wav|bezel right there next to the earpiece slit. The earpiece doesn't have any exterior grills.
dataset/train/72_31.wav|The sides of the phone are more rugged than usual and are made out of a hard, rough,
dataset/train/72_32.wav|textured plastic. You might have noticed that there's also a plethora of buttons along the side.
dataset/train/72_33.wav|The bottom button is a textured camera button that can activate the camera to take pictures
dataset/train/72_34.wav|just like a shutter button. Right above that we have a programmable button that can activate any
dataset/train/72_35.wav|app or startup its external monitor features – both of which are made from metal. Above that,
dataset/train/72_36.wav|we have the recessed power button which also doubles as a fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/72_37.wav|We'll get back to that. Then up top we have the volume rocker, which is also made from metal.
dataset/train/72_38.wav|The Xperia logo is just overlayed and painted onto the plastic
dataset/train/72_39.wav|and will probably eventually rub off in your pocket. The “Pro” part of that logo is inlaid
dataset/train/72_40.wav|three deminsionally and is the only part of the branding that won't rub off on it's own.
dataset/train/72_41.wav|Up at the top of the phone we do have that headphone jack. It's kind of strange that in
dataset/train/72_42.wav|order to get a headphone jack on your phone these days you either got to spend $2,000 or $200. The
dataset/train/72_43.wav|right side of the phone has no buttons, just more textured plastic. It does have a SIM and SD card
dataset/train/72_44.wav|tray that does not need a removal tool. It can pull out with just your fingers. It makes it much
dataset/train/72_45.wav|easier to swap memory cards, which is a pretty professional feature. You might also have noticed
dataset/train/72_46.wav|that this phone has an IP rating of IP65/IP68. Kind of strange. And that's because down here at
dataset/train/72_47.wav|the bottom things start getting weird. Alongside the normal USB-C port there is a full on micro
dataset/train/72_48.wav|HDMI port. This is how the Xperia Pro gets its high quality 4K 60FPS footage imported from the
dataset/train/72_49.wav|full frame DSLR for streaming over 5G. If you understood all that, congrats on being hip lit
dataset/train/72_50.wav|with your Gucci on fleek. And if you're a little lost, well, there's always bingo night. Long story
dataset/train/72_51.wav|short, this phone is IP68 when the flap is closed, and when it's open it's only IP65. So be careful.
dataset/train/72_52.wav|On the back of the Xperia Pro it does have some cameras of its own:
dataset/train/72_53.wav|a 12 megapixel telephoto lens, a 12 megapixel wide angle lens,
dataset/train/72_54.wav|a 3D time-of-flight depth camera. And then down at the bottom we have the 12 megapixel main camera.
dataset/train/72_55.wav|Nothing super crazy, special, or out of the ordinary, but Sony is really good at making
dataset/train/72_56.wav|cameras. It's kind of their thing. The NFC pad is located in the center of the back panel,
dataset/train/72_57.wav|right underneath this symbol here. There is no wireless charging.
dataset/train/72_58.wav|Now, Sony has been around for a really long time. They are one of the largest
dataset/train/72_59.wav|companies in the world. They've got their logo subtly recessed into the back of the phone.
dataset/train/72_60.wav|One of Sony's very first products they ever made was a transistor radio back in 1955.
dataset/train/72_61.wav|Then in 1957 they made the world's smallest portable radio that really took off,
dataset/train/72_62.wav|putting Sony on the map. The name “Sony” is derived from the Latin word for sound,
dataset/train/72_63.wav|which makes sense since they were, you know, making radios. Before all that though,
dataset/train/72_64.wav|one of their very first products ever was a rice cooker, which is what you see here. Bet you didn't
dataset/train/72_65.wav|see that one coming. Personally, I for one am glad Sony branched out and explored new markets.
dataset/train/72_66.wav|The back panel of the Xperia Pro does look to be glued down and is water resistant.
dataset/train/72_67.wav|Sony phones are normally notoriously difficult and complicated to take apart.
dataset/train/72_68.wav|But maybe this time will be different. Make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss the tear down.
dataset/train/72_69.wav|The screen is still my favorite part of the phone. With 10 bits of color and 4K resolution,
dataset/train/72_70.wav|it all sounds super impressive, until you remember that last year's Xperia 1 II
dataset/train/72_71.wav|also had a 10 bit 4K display and it only cost $1,000. This might hurt Sony's feelings,
dataset/train/72_72.wav|but I think that if you don't need the very very specific ability to live stream bingo night in
dataset/train/72_73.wav|full frame 4K 60FPS, then last year's mark II is definitely the better choice of cellphone.
dataset/train/72_74.wav|The OLED does last 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter though.
dataset/train/72_75.wav|Finally, the Xperia Pro does have a side mounted capacitive fingerprint reader.
dataset/train/72_76.wav|I've already scratched it once, and for the most part it still works to read my finger.
dataset/train/72_77.wav|If I add a few more scratches after the fingerprint is set,
dataset/train/72_78.wav|it still manages to function most of the time...just not all the time.
dataset/train/72_79.wav|Finally, the bend test. I'm a big fan of the rugged design of this Xperia Pro. The recessed
dataset/train/72_80.wav|camera lens, and extra plastic back make for a much more durable phone design with less exposed
dataset/train/72_81.wav|glass parts to break. Structurally, when bent from the back there is a slight curve to the phone,
dataset/train/72_82.wav|which since it's so long it's kind of expected. But it does lock out and doesn't break.
dataset/train/72_83.wav|When bent from the front, we get the same thing, a slight bend but the $2,500 smartphone holds
dataset/train/72_84.wav|strong and stays in one piece. Not too shabby. Interesting how the most rugged looking phone
dataset/train/72_85.wav|that we've tested in quite a while is also the most expensive by far. It's like a sleeper phone.
dataset/train/72_86.wav|Moral of the story though: if you really need a 4K display, just grab last year's Xperia Mark II. The
dataset/train/72_87.wav|rest of us will be just fine with all the other phones that have professional in the name but are
dataset/train/72_88.wav|actually just pretending. The people this phone was really built for are probably all
dataset/train/72_89.wav|still out there working right now. While you're watching this video, they're out there being
dataset/train/72_90.wav|all professional and stuff with no time for the internet, or a computer. You know...workaholics.
dataset/train/72_91.wav|Let me know what you think. Would you ever use a phone like this?
dataset/train/72_92.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter, and hit that subscribe
dataset/train/72_93.wav|button if you haven't already. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/73_1.wav|Well, here we are, back again for another video
dataset/train/73_2.wav|with this guy – a phone that's supposedly made for you.
dataset/train/73_3.wav|The Fairphone 3. The Fairphone has been on my radar for a few years now, but this is the first
dataset/train/73_4.wav|time our paths have actually crossed in real life. And I know I'm supposed to be impartial,
dataset/train/73_5.wav|but I'm kind of rooting for this one since it comes with its very own screwdriver
dataset/train/73_6.wav|already in the box. Let's get started.
dataset/train/73_7.wav|Inside the box there isn't a whole lot else besides the phone and that niblet of a
dataset/train/73_8.wav|screwdriver. No charging brick either. Fairphone's whole deal is trying to build the least
dataset/train/73_9.wav|wasteful smartphone and does that by making the device super modular, with common and sometimes
dataset/train/73_10.wav|older components. It's so modular that the 3,000 milliamp hour battery can be replaced in seconds
dataset/train/73_11.wav|by just popping off the back. Something that used to be super common but we haven't seen in years.
dataset/train/73_12.wav|Every other piece of hardware in the phone can also be replaced with just one screwdriver,
dataset/train/73_13.wav|with parts that Fairphone supplies themselves directly from their website. This might be the
dataset/train/73_14.wav|only phone in existence that gets a tear down before the durability test since it's
dataset/train/73_15.wav|specifically designed to be torn down, and taking it apart won't compromise any of its structural
dataset/train/73_16.wav|integrity. It even says over here on the side “designed to open.” I'm all about that life.
dataset/train/73_17.wav|With all the screws gone, the modular screen can fall away from the body.
dataset/train/73_18.wav|No Lego-style ribbons to disconnect. Just a thin and totally modular display. With every other
dataset/train/73_19.wav|phone being so much more difficult to take apart, this almost feels like cheating. The
dataset/train/73_20.wav|little gold pins do all of the communicating with the motherboard, and replacement screens
dataset/train/73_21.wav|can be purchased for about $100. My grandma could probably fix this phone by herself.
dataset/train/73_22.wav|The modularity doesn't stop there either. There are more screws of course, but when
dataset/train/73_23.wav|those are gone, the Lego-style connectors can be unsnapped and each component safely and
dataset/train/73_24.wav|easily removed from the phone. The front camera module and earpiece. And then over here we have
dataset/train/73_25.wav|the singular rear camera module that comes out the same way. These little parts are not
dataset/train/73_26.wav|the bare components and circuit board, but more of a modular plastic puzzle piece that's pretty
dataset/train/73_27.wav|foolproof to swap out. Same thing goes for the loudspeaker and charging port. The cool thing is,
dataset/train/73_28.wav|if I understand it right, some of the parts can even be upgraded within model years as well.
dataset/train/73_29.wav|Like if you bought the Fairphone 3 and the Fairphone 3 Plus comes out, you can just purchase
dataset/train/73_30.wav|the newer camera modules and plop them into your older phone...and boom, new phone. Who dis?
dataset/train/73_31.wav|It's kind of an abnormally reasonable concept. Computer components have been upgradeable since
dataset/train/73_32.wav|the beginning. (Unless you own a Mac.) So it's cool that Fairphone is attempting to do the same
dataset/train/73_33.wav|thing. It's got dual SIM card slots, as well as expandable memory with an SD card slot...which
dataset/train/73_34.wav|is actually pretty important this time around since the
dataset/train/73_35.wav|motherboard only has 64 gigs of onboard storage.
dataset/train/73_36.wav|With everything back in place and both cameras still working, it's time to really get started.
dataset/train/73_37.wav|Keep in mind that this phone is in the $500 price range and it's overall goal isn't to
dataset/train/73_38.wav|contain the best of the best. We'll get the scratch test going. As you know,
dataset/train/73_39.wav|if the screen starts scratching at a level 3 it's made from plastic, and a 5 or a 6 would be glass,
dataset/train/73_40.wav|and an 8 or a 9 would be sapphire. The Fairphone 3 is using Gorilla Glass 5
dataset/train/73_41.wav|and we start seeing scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/73_42.wav|The front camera is protected under that same front glass.
dataset/train/73_43.wav|It's a 16 megapixel selfie camera tucked into the top bezel,
dataset/train/73_44.wav|along with the weird looking plastic earpiece. No other buttons,
dataset/train/73_45.wav|just another large bezel with the Fairphone logo down at the bottom of the phone. Rotating
dataset/train/73_46.wav|the phone to the side, we see the “designed to open” letters engraved into the plastic edges.
dataset/train/73_47.wav|It's a soft plastic though and is the same color all the way through.
dataset/train/73_48.wav|The top of the phone has a microphone and a headphone jack.
dataset/train/73_49.wav|Nice to see him again. Then we have metal volume buttons, a textured metal power button,
dataset/train/73_50.wav|and more plastic next to the back panel removal slit and loudspeaker, which is indeed over here
dataset/train/73_51.wav|on the side of the phone. Then of course, we have the USB-C port down at the bottom.
dataset/train/73_52.wav|From the outside, and kind of from the inside, it looks like this phone belongs in 2018
dataset/train/73_53.wav|instead of 2021. But remember, being mainstream isn't the goal of the Fairphone.
dataset/train/73_54.wav|Fairphone is all about making a phone that's good for the environment.
dataset/train/73_55.wav|All of the components are ethically sourced with factory workers getting fair wages, and
dataset/train/73_56.wav|is repairable for longevity. And as we see, the whole thing is made from 40% recycled plastics,
dataset/train/73_57.wav|all of which are very noble endeavors for any company and definitely deserve a thumbs up.
dataset/train/73_58.wav|The scene of the rear camera is 48 megapixels and does not have optical image stabilization,
dataset/train/73_59.wav|but is covered in scratch-resistant glass which is good.
dataset/train/73_60.wav|The fingerprint scanner is also here on the back. It's capactivite and can be scratched.
dataset/train/73_61.wav|But even with that extreme damage on the surface
dataset/train/73_62.wav|it's still able to read my fingerprint and unlock the phone most of the time.
dataset/train/73_63.wav|We've seen a lot of things today that we haven't seen in a while and the screen is no different.
dataset/train/73_64.wav|It's a 5.6 inch 1080p display. And as you can tell from the way the pixels go black and can't turn
dataset/train/73_65.wav|off, it's using an IPS LCD instead of an AMOLED. The average person on the street, of course, won't
dataset/train/73_66.wav|notice the difference or even really care, but super nerds like us know that the flame has once
dataset/train/73_67.wav|again spoken and revealed all. I mean, so far the Fairphone 3 has been assembled much more securely
dataset/train/73_68.wav|than I expected. It's a thick, heavy and beefy phone with a lot of screws. It might not have
dataset/train/73_69.wav|the water resistance or the latest hardware, but I am optimistic that it might survive the bend test.
dataset/train/73_70.wav|When bent from the back we do get a decent curve to the phone,
dataset/train/73_71.wav|but it locks out and does not break or shatter. The screen does stop working though.
dataset/train/73_72.wav|I imagine one of the gold contact pads lost connection on the inside
dataset/train/73_73.wav|just for a moment, or maybe it touched a pin that it wasn't supposed to. But
dataset/train/73_74.wav|after turning the screen off and back on again, everything recovered and went back to normal.
dataset/train/73_75.wav|Bending from the front has another curve. The back panel wants to come off.
dataset/train/73_76.wav|But the phone, once again, does not break. The internal removable battery has a hard shell
dataset/train/73_77.wav|which helps. And since the phone is pretty thick and heavy,
dataset/train/73_78.wav|there is no major surprise that the whole thing is structurally sound.
dataset/train/73_79.wav|I'm a pretty big fan of this Fairphone concept. But I do think that in order for
dataset/train/73_80.wav|this idea to go more mainstream, there does need to be a few more mainstream components,
dataset/train/73_81.wav|like specifically the cameras. A telephoto and wide angle perspective have been the norm for
dataset/train/73_82.wav|a few years now and a single camera dates the Fairphone 3 pretty hard. I'm still a fan though.
dataset/train/73_83.wav|And judging by the amount of people who watch my videos, there's definitely a market for solid,
dataset/train/73_84.wav|repairable smartphones. And I think we can all look forward to seeing what Fairphone comes out
dataset/train/73_85.wav|with next. Nice work. Let me know what you think of this new contender down in the comments. And
dataset/train/73_86.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/74_1.wav|So I'm a huge fan of this Xiaomi Mi 11 color scheme. It's got the subtle glow
dataset/train/74_2.wav|you'd get by lighting a robin's egg on fire. It seems like only cheaper phones
dataset/train/74_3.wav|get the cool colors these days. We're going to take apart this new Xiaomi Mi 11 and see
dataset/train/74_4.wav|what that 50 watt wireless charging looks like from the inside. Let's get started.
dataset/train/74_5.wav|Once again, in order to get inside of this glass backed smartphone we have to break out
dataset/train/74_6.wav|the heat gun. The Mi 11 does not have an official IP rating, but it is still glued
dataset/train/74_7.wav|together pretty tight. The hotter the phone gets the easier it is to remove the glass.
dataset/train/74_8.wav|There's a little sweet spot where the adhesive gets loose. It's right there between being barely
dataset/train/74_9.wav|too hot to touch and the battery exploding. With a little upward pulling motion on my suction cup,
dataset/train/74_10.wav|I can slip my pry tool and razor blade in to slice away that soft adhesive.
dataset/train/74_11.wav|And then as you can see, with a little more heat, the back can literally pull right off.
dataset/train/74_12.wav|With the panel gone we get our first look at that wireless charging pad.
dataset/train/74_13.wav|It's only got one large copper circle. I was curious to see if there might have been
dataset/train/74_14.wav|multiple since 50 watts of wireless is pretty extreme. We'll get a closer look in a second.
dataset/train/74_15.wav|There are 9 screws holding down the top plastics and camera lens.
dataset/train/74_16.wav|These screws are all tinted green except for the ones around that camera.
dataset/train/74_17.wav|These are different sizes so I'll keep them separate and organized, because like always,
dataset/train/74_18.wav|it's nice when the phones survive the teardown and I can get it all put back together.
dataset/train/74_19.wav|With the camera lens unplugged we can see that it's actually made from
dataset/train/74_20.wav|metal underneath - cnc'd aluminum. We can tell by the machining marks on the back,
dataset/train/74_21.wav|and underneath the glass layer on top it's got a dual colored LED flash.
dataset/train/74_22.wav|Next I can lift off the wireless charging coil and the NFC pad. It's impressive that
dataset/train/74_23.wav|this guy can handle 50 watts of wireless charging and 10 watts of reverse wireless.
dataset/train/74_24.wav|Most phones can only do about half of that. We can see little strands of copper inside
dataset/train/74_25.wav|that generate the magnetic field that allows it to send and receive power.
dataset/train/74_26.wav|I'll unplug the two battery connections and the two extension ribbons – all unclipping like
dataset/train/74_27.wav|little Legos. I was curious to see how Xiaomi can manage all of the power coming into this phone,
dataset/train/74_28.wav|and it looks like the battery is indeed divided into two separate parts.
dataset/train/74_29.wav|Adhesive under the battery is also pretty chill. Nice work, Xiaomi. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/74_30.wav|And even though it appears to be one solid battery, it's still got the two plugs,
dataset/train/74_31.wav|which makes me think that all the charging juice is being divided between two cells. And since
dataset/train/74_32.wav|it's like two batteries being charged at the same time, it charges faster, pulling double the normal
dataset/train/74_33.wav|power. It's cool to see what solutions different companies come up with. A Tesla, for example,
dataset/train/74_34.wav|has about 6,000 batteries and can absorb power pretty fast when all charge at the same time.
dataset/train/74_35.wav|The bottom speaker is held in place with 7 screws. Still the same little green guys. I'll link the
dataset/train/74_36.wav|toolkit I”m using in the video description. With the wires unplugged from the speaker,
dataset/train/74_37.wav|it comes free from the phone and we can check it for balls. And indeed, underneath the little
dataset/train/74_38.wav|sticker are thousands of foam sound dampening balls. These help the speaker sound bigger than
dataset/train/74_39.wav|it actually is. The balls give the speaker more surface area inside for the sound to
dataset/train/74_40.wav|resonate off of. There's also waterproofing on the speaker unit itself. Kind of fun.
dataset/train/74_41.wav|I'll remove the dual SIM card tray, along with both extension ribbons. And then we have access
dataset/train/74_42.wav|to the charging port board with it's white water damage indicator near the USB-C port, which also
dataset/train/74_43.wav|has a black rubber ring around the opening. That black rubber though isn't the only water
dataset/train/74_44.wav|protection. Down here by the square vibrator and the speaker opening we get another waterproof mesh
dataset/train/74_45.wav|with it's own rubber seal. The Mi 11 might not have an official IP rating, but it still does have
dataset/train/74_46.wav|protection against water. Let's move up to the top of the phone so we can check out the cameras.
dataset/train/74_47.wav|The front facing hole punch camera can pop out of the phone. It's 20 megapixels and
dataset/train/74_48.wav|does not have any optical image stabilization, which is pretty normal. I'll unplug the other
dataset/train/74_49.wav|two smaller cameras on the back and remove one remaining screw holding the motherboard down.
dataset/train/74_50.wav|Then that board can lift up and out of the phone exposing the liquid cooling vapor
dataset/train/74_51.wav|chamber that Xiaomi mentioned, and also quite a bit more copper on the back side of the board.
dataset/train/74_52.wav|From here I can unplug the large 108 megapixel camera sensor
dataset/train/74_53.wav|and we get access to all three rear cameras. The bottom ultra wide 13 megapixel sensor does not
dataset/train/74_54.wav|have OIS, but the large 108 megapixel sensor in the center does. The optical image stabilization
dataset/train/74_55.wav|is pretty important on a main camera. Then we have the 5 megapixel macro camera off to the side which
dataset/train/74_56.wav|does not have OIS. With the front screen having super small bezels, the proximity sensor, which is
dataset/train/74_57.wav|the little guy that turns off the screen when it's next to your face, is hidden under the display,
dataset/train/74_58.wav|just like an optical fingerprint scanner. And it sits there right next to the earpiece speaker.
dataset/train/74_59.wav|Finally, let's get a look at this liquid cooling or the vapor chamber.
dataset/train/74_60.wav|Basically these have some form of liquid or gas inside that helps facilitate the transfer of heat.
dataset/train/74_61.wav|The hot gas or liquid inside gets pushed away from the hot processor,
dataset/train/74_62.wav|then a thin mesh wicks it back to the center after it cools down so it can repeat the
dataset/train/74_63.wav|cooling process. Sometimes we can visibly see liquid droplets inside of this vapor chamber,
dataset/train/74_64.wav|but not this time around. Depending on the gas used, it could have evaporated instantly when
dataset/train/74_65.wav|it's cut open so I'm not too worried. Plus, copper would do a good job conducting heat all by itself.
dataset/train/74_66.wav|The underscreen fingerprint scanner is tucked between the frame and the screen, which means it
dataset/train/74_67.wav|probably does not have a lens and might be why it wasn't the best at reading my fingerprint after I
dataset/train/74_68.wav|scratched it. It's just a flat sensor doing all of the work. In order for us to see it though,
dataset/train/74_69.wav|I would have to destroy the screen. And since the screen is the best part of the phone, we're
dataset/train/74_70.wav|just going to leave it in peace. Overall, I like what I see. Xiaomi made a beast of a phone and
dataset/train/74_71.wav|slapped a fair price on top. I'm still not totally sure if they're allowed in the USA at the moment.
dataset/train/74_72.wav|Our government has been erratic for quite some time. But things will start settling down soon.
dataset/train/74_73.wav|With the battery back in place and both of its connectors plugged in, I can get the wireless
dataset/train/74_74.wav|charging pad back on top, along with the aluminum camera housing and all of the screws that hold the
dataset/train/74_75.wav|whole thing together. It's time to see if the Mi 11 survived the teardown, and indeed it has. Let's
dataset/train/74_76.wav|hope 2021 is the year of normal price cell phones again. I think that would be a win for everyone.
dataset/train/74_77.wav|Another win for everyone would be hitting that subscribe button if you haven't already, and
dataset/train/74_78.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/75_1.wav|The Xiaomi Mi 11 has been causing a few wrinkles in the smartphone world, mostly due to it's
dataset/train/75_2.wav|ridiculous specs at a super low price point. The Mi 11 might look good on paper, it also
dataset/train/75_3.wav|might look good in real life, but today we're going to find out if it's good structurally,
dataset/train/75_4.wav|and how much abuse we can expect it to survive over it's lifetime. I've had a few Mi phones
dataset/train/75_5.wav|not survive my durability tests in the past, so this should be interesting. In my box I
dataset/train/75_6.wav|got a rather impressive 55 watt fast charger, which is definitely something else we need
dataset/train/75_7.wav|to talk about. Let's get started.
dataset/train/75_8.wav|At first glance, the Mi 11 looks a lot like other mainstream smartphones. This color is
dataset/train/75_9.wav|called the Horizon Blue – aptly named with its golden sunrise vibe. Let's start out with
dataset/train/75_10.wav|the scratch test. This time around we won't get fooled by the included screen protector.
dataset/train/75_11.wav|While Samsung provides two, Xiaomi only applies one. At $600 this Mi 11 could fall into the
dataset/train/75_12.wav|'everything is made from plastic' category. Or it could all be glass. Plastic would start
dataset/train/75_13.wav|scratching at a Mohs 2 or 3, while glass would start scratching at a level 5 or 6. And, of
dataset/train/75_14.wav|course, sapphire would scratch at a level 8 or 9. I do hear rumors about another sapphire
dataset/train/75_15.wav|screen smartphone coming out later this year, but this Mi 11 is not it. Using Gorilla Glass
dataset/train/75_16.wav|Victus, we see scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. Perfectly on
dataset/train/75_17.wav|par with other flagships that are twice as expensive.
dataset/train/75_18.wav|The front facing camera is 20 megapixels with its little hole punch cut out. It's also got
dataset/train/75_19.wav|super curved glass along the side edges and the top edge, which isn't really my thing
dataset/train/75_20.wav|but I don't think it would bother me very much either. Something that does bother me
dataset/train/75_21.wav|though is people not putting their shopping carts away. Like for real, it's not that hard
dataset/train/75_22.wav|to do.
dataset/train/75_23.wav|The sides of the Mi 11 are made from metal, which is good, along with the buttons. At
dataset/train/75_24.wav|$600 the body could go either way, metal or plastic, so it's nice to have an official
dataset/train/75_25.wav|verdict...Even though durability-wise we've found that plastic phones are just as structural
dataset/train/75_26.wav|as metal phones. So I 'm really fine either way, I just like knowing.
dataset/train/75_27.wav|The top of the phone does have it's IR blaster, along with, if we zoom in, some Harman/Kardon
dataset/train/75_28.wav|speakers. Apparently Harman/Kardon is a premium speaker manufacturer who tuned Xiaomi's speakers
dataset/train/75_29.wav|and then let Xiaomi slap their brand name on the phone. Normally this is annoying because
dataset/train/75_30.wav|it raises the price, but it's hard to get mad at a phone that's still half the price
dataset/train/75_31.wav|of other professional flagships.
dataset/train/75_32.wav|There is a SIM card tray down at the bottom. No SD card slot, but there is room for two
dataset/train/75_33.wav|SIM cards. The thing that's most interesting to me though about this Mi 11 is the wireless
dataset/train/75_34.wav|charging. We already know that the USB-C at the bottom can do 55 watts, which is a lot
dataset/train/75_35.wav|of power. Usually, in order to get numbers like that, the battery gets divided in half
dataset/train/75_36.wav|and each half is charged up at the same time. But we've never seen wireless charging at
dataset/train/75_37.wav|50 watts, which is what the Mi 11's claiming.
dataset/train/75_38.wav|Since the back panel is made from glass, we can't see the wireless charging coil or those
dataset/train/75_39.wav|split batteries, but I am looking forward to seeing how it all works from the inside.
dataset/train/75_40.wav|We can see from the outside, however, the cameras. Once again Xiaomi is using the 108
dataset/train/75_41.wav|megapixel sensor, usually reserved for the professional world for Ultra phones that cost
dataset/train/75_42.wav|twice as much, but this is just a regular old Mi 11 using professional body parts. It
dataset/train/75_43.wav|also has a 13 megapixel ultra wide camera and a 5 megapixel macro camera. One thing
dataset/train/75_44.wav|I have a minor issue with is the underscreen fingerprint scanner. These have been common
dataset/train/75_45.wav|now for a few years, but for me they've never totally been foolproof since my hands seem
dataset/train/75_46.wav|to always be wet or dirty when I want to use it. And optical scanners aren't good in situations
dataset/train/75_47.wav|like that. When I add my level 7 deeper grooves over the glass on top of the fingerprint scanner,
dataset/train/75_48.wav|it does seem to struggle a little bit more reading my fingerprint, but still does work
dataset/train/75_49.wav|most of the time...just not all the time. My fingers aren't perfect though so do keep
dataset/train/75_50.wav|that in mind.
dataset/train/75_51.wav|I would say that the biggest improvement on this phone that super nerds like us can appreciate
dataset/train/75_52.wav|is the screen. The 6.8 inch OLED display checks all the boxes at 1440p, 10 bits of color,
dataset/train/75_53.wav|and 120 Hertz refresh rate. And even though it's not technically a gaming phone, it has
dataset/train/75_54.wav|a 480 Hertz touch sampling rate, which means it's really quick at sensing your finger and
dataset/train/75_55.wav|is insanely fast. For a nonprofessional phone this guy is probably been making a lot of
dataset/train/75_56.wav|professional phones nervous. And of course it lasts about 20 seconds under the heat from
dataset/train/75_57.wav|my lighter before going white and not totally recovering. Xiaomi says they have a new liquid
dataset/train/75_58.wav|cooling heat dissipation system inside which should be fun to check out.
dataset/train/75_59.wav|Speaking of which, the insides of the phone might very well be the outsides soon since
dataset/train/75_60.wav|Xiaomi doesn't always pass my bend tests. With the initial bend there was a small unnerving
dataset/train/75_61.wav|pop but no major catastrophic damage. Flipping the phone over we get another small bend but
dataset/train/75_62.wav|nothing permanent, no kinks or cracks. Whether bent from the back or the front, this Xiaomi
dataset/train/75_63.wav|Mi 11 passes my durability test. In my opinion, judging by the specs, build quality and the
dataset/train/75_64.wav|price, the Mi 11 is a professional phone that's just pretending not to be. Nice work, Xiaomi.
dataset/train/75_65.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already so we can see that 50 watt wireless charging
dataset/train/75_66.wav|and cooling system during the teardown video. And come hang out with me on Instagram and
dataset/train/75_67.wav|Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/76_1.wav|Hi. Today we're going to take apart the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. We'll get a good look at those cameras,
dataset/train/76_2.wav|and supposedly it's 77% larger underscreen fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/76_3.wav|Should be interesting. Let's get started.
dataset/train/76_4.wav|The S21 Ultra might have a slightly different contoured camera bump this time around,
dataset/train/76_5.wav|but the process to open her up is still basically the same as all the other Samsungs
dataset/train/76_6.wav|we've seen for the past 6 years - a lot of heat and gentle prying. My second batch of
dataset/train/76_7.wav|knives is all sold out by the way, but we will have a third batch coming in May or
dataset/train/76_8.wav|June if you want to preorder one of those and join the cool knife club. Jerryrigknife.com.
dataset/train/76_9.wav|The large camera bump actually makes the rear glass removal quite a bit easier,
dataset/train/76_10.wav|which is nice since the textured back makes it a little bit harder. My suction cup has a hard time
dataset/train/76_11.wav|gripping that rough surface. But eventually we do get the back panel off. The camera lens is metal,
dataset/train/76_12.wav|but the little circles inside the metal housing are glass and can be replaced if they ever break.
dataset/train/76_13.wav|Two of the camera protrusion sides are made from the sides of the phone that just extend upwards.
dataset/train/76_14.wav|The camera bump is still rather large compared to other phones, but I like this implementation.
dataset/train/76_15.wav|There are 14 normal Phillips head screws holding down the phone guts to the frame.
dataset/train/76_16.wav|I'll unplug the rear wireless charging coil, and the NFC pad right above that. Getting a closer
dataset/train/76_17.wav|look at the coils shows us that there are actually two coils of copper inside this pad. It could be
dataset/train/76_18.wav|that one of them is for the 15 watts of normal wireless charging, and the other is for the 4.5
dataset/train/76_19.wav|watts of reverse wireless charging. I don't know enough about electromagnetic induction to say
dataset/train/76_20.wav|for certain though. I do know, however, that the battery connector can unsnap like a little Lego,
dataset/train/76_21.wav|along with the side buttons, rear LED flash, and earpiece speaker.
dataset/train/76_22.wav|The earpiece unit of the S21 Ultra is water resistant, with its own rubber gasket around the
dataset/train/76_23.wav|edge. Kind of cool. It sits inside of the frame next to the square vibrator. It's a bit a ways
dataset/train/76_24.wav|from the slit in the front phone. The speaker just channels its sound to that slit through the
dataset/train/76_25.wav|gap in between the phone frame and the screen. It's a little tunnel of tones, if you will.
dataset/train/76_26.wav|I'll unplug the front facing camera, along with a few other ribbons, and the super long extensions
dataset/train/76_27.wav|that go between the main board and the charging port. This phone is one of the international S21
dataset/train/76_28.wav|Ultra variants, which means that the millimeter wave antennas are missing from the sides,
dataset/train/76_29.wav|even though it does still say 5G on the box. It's another one of Samsung's weird advertising quirks,
dataset/train/76_30.wav|alongside their Exynos and Qualcomm performance differences. And by quirks, I mean it's a stretch
dataset/train/76_31.wav|to even consider the international and domestic variants to be the same product.
dataset/train/76_32.wav|The camera units take up a huge portion of real estate inside of the phone with 4 lenses and
dataset/train/76_33.wav|massive internal sensors. The cameras are one of the main selling points of this new phone.
dataset/train/76_34.wav|Up top we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide, which does not have OIS.
dataset/train/76_35.wav|The 108 megapixel main camera does have OIS,
dataset/train/76_36.wav|along with the 10 megapixel 3x telephoto zoom which also has OIS. The periscope camera has
dataset/train/76_37.wav|the OIS internally. I did take the periscope portion apart in last year's S20 Ultra video.
dataset/train/76_38.wav|I'll link that down in the description. It's pretty cool to see. We have some graphite behind
dataset/train/76_39.wav|the cameras, under the motherboard, and against the screen to help with the heat dissipation.
dataset/train/76_40.wav|The top front facing 40 megapixel camera is actually glued into the frame...very securely,
dataset/train/76_41.wav|might I add. Trying to remove it actually ripped the sensor from the back side of the camera,
dataset/train/76_42.wav|which means it's probably toast, but we'll find out for sure when I put it all back together.
dataset/train/76_43.wav|I'll pop off the bottom plastics. This is where the second stereo speaker is located.
dataset/train/76_44.wav|This guy does have the sound dampening foam balls inside.
dataset/train/76_45.wav|The bottom board does have three screws of its own holding it in place,
dataset/train/76_46.wav|along with a singular SIM card slot. This slot does not have any expandable memory,
dataset/train/76_47.wav|but the USB-C does have a similar IP68 red rubber ring, just like we saw around the top earpiece.
dataset/train/76_48.wav|In order for us to find that new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, we have to remove the
dataset/train/76_49.wav|battery, which unfortunately for us is a Samsung battery. The glue holding this thing together will
dataset/train/76_50.wav|outlast the entire universe. Even with isopropyl alcohol to dissolve the adhesive
dataset/train/76_51.wav|and heat, it's still a doozy to remove. It's pretty crazy, but eventually doable.
dataset/train/76_52.wav|Dogs are allowed this time, if you know what I mean.
dataset/train/76_53.wav|Now, the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is easy to spot at this point and it is huge. It has the
dataset/train/76_54.wav|largest footprint of any fingerprint scanner we've ever seen. It's so big you might even be able to
dataset/train/76_55.wav|use your footprint. We'll do a little side by side size comparison between this ultrasonic and last
dataset/train/76_56.wav|year's 20 ultrasonic scanner. Not only is this one much larger, but there's also less empty space
dataset/train/76_57.wav|around the scanner itself. Jumping 77 in size in just two years is a big improvement. MKBHD's dream
dataset/train/76_58.wav|of seeing a fingerprint scanner that covers half the phone could be a reality within the
dataset/train/76_59.wav|next year or two. Overall, I'm going to say that the S21 Ultra didn't do anything crazy, unique,
dataset/train/76_60.wav|or new this year, it's just the same consistent Samsung experience that we've gotten for years,
dataset/train/76_61.wav|with it's incremental improvements. And even though this particular phone might
dataset/train/76_62.wav|not be calling my name, I'm sure it will get the job done for anyone who does get one.
dataset/train/76_63.wav|I'll get the wireless charging coils back into place so we can check the front facing camera
dataset/train/76_64.wav|that I decapitated. The phone still turns on, so I'll get the back glass situated.
dataset/train/76_65.wav|The rear camera looks to be working fine, but as soon as I turn it to the front camera it fritzes
dataset/train/76_66.wav|out and doesn't want to display any images, which I don't blame him. I wouldn't really want to work
dataset/train/76_67.wav|if someone ripped me in half either. Accidents happen, which is why if you want to see your phone
dataset/train/76_68.wav|from the inside, it's a whole lot safer just to get one of my Teardown Skins. All of the beautiful
dataset/train/76_69.wav|internals without any of the decapitations. I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skin down in the
dataset/train/76_70.wav|video description. Let me know what you think of the S21 Ultra down in the comments...I'm curious.
dataset/train/76_71.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/76_72.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/77_1.wav|The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the latest and greatest thing in the Android world...at least for the
dataset/train/77_2.wav|next couple months. A little side note: if you order a JerryRigEverything razor knife,
dataset/train/77_3.wav|our second batch will be shipping out later this week, so be on the lookout for that. The S21 Ultra
dataset/train/77_4.wav|box looks like it's lost a bit of weight since last year. Either it's spent quarantine working
dataset/train/77_5.wav|out and eating right, or Samsung's just copying Apple and leaving out the charger.
dataset/train/77_6.wav|Once the phone is out we get our first look at the maddest, blackest phone I think I've ever seen.
dataset/train/77_7.wav|It's like filming a black hole. The S21 Ultra is as dark as 2020.
dataset/train/77_8.wav|My fingers are also a little bit dark. I've been working with metal and that stuff does
dataset/train/77_9.wav|not wash off real easy. But since this isn't Jerry Manicure Everything, let's get started.
dataset/train/77_10.wav|Inside the slender box, we get a short USB-C to USB-C charging cable,
dataset/train/77_11.wav|and that's about it. For the most part the phone doesn't look much different than last year.
dataset/train/77_12.wav|We still have the hole punched camera in the front. Changing the look of that camera bump
dataset/train/77_13.wav|is about as much innovation as we're getting these days. Everything else is just marginal,
dataset/train/77_14.wav|incremental improvements. Which is good of course, don't get me wrong.
dataset/train/77_15.wav|I'll peel off the screen protector and we can make our way down to the screen and start our
dataset/train/77_16.wav|scratch test. Anything that scratches at a level 2 or 3 would be made from plastic.
dataset/train/77_17.wav|And as we can clearly see, the S21 Ultra scratches at a level 3. You guys saw me
dataset/train/77_18.wav|remove that screen protector, right? Well, Samsung, with all of their generosity,
dataset/train/77_19.wav|gives us a screen protector for the screen protector. The innovation just doesn't stop.
dataset/train/77_20.wav|Anyway, like I was saying, things that scratch at a Mohs 2 or 3 are plastic.
dataset/train/77_21.wav|Levels 5 or 6 would be glass, and levels 8 or 9 would be sapphire.
dataset/train/77_22.wav|A 10 would be a diamond. After removing both screen protectors we can see that the S21 Ultra
dataset/train/77_23.wav|scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. It's using Gorilla Glass Victus.
dataset/train/77_24.wav|The top hole punch front facing camera is 40 megapixels protected under that front glass.
dataset/train/77_25.wav|There's also a slit up here about one razor blade thick for the earpiece and top stereo
dataset/train/77_26.wav|speaker. The sides of the phone are protected with a very thin piece of temporary plastic.
dataset/train/77_27.wav|If Samsung is shrinking their box to be more environmentally friendly,
dataset/train/77_28.wav|they still sure are using a lot of plastic.
dataset/train/77_29.wav|The sides of the phone are made from aluminum, along with a power button and volume rocker –
dataset/train/77_30.wav|both made from metal. The top of the phone is kind of unique.
dataset/train/77_31.wav|The camera hump is blended into the sides of the aluminum frame. Samsung is calling this a
dataset/train/77_32.wav|contour cut, which I actually kind of like. It's a little more seamless. Then down here at the bottom
dataset/train/77_33.wav|near the 25 watt fast charging USB-C port, we get the SIM card tray. It is IP68, but new this year,
dataset/train/77_34.wav|Samsung has removed the expandable memory card slot, which is kind of sad. I'm not a huge fan
dataset/train/77_35.wav|of removing features. I'd rather have a tool and not need it, than need a tool and not have it.
dataset/train/77_36.wav|One thing I do like though, was the frosted glass on the back.
dataset/train/77_37.wav|We've seen this for a while on OnePlus and iPhones, and I like it every single time.
dataset/train/77_38.wav|It's a little more abrasive than smooth glass. You can see that bits of my razor,
dataset/train/77_39.wav|keys, and coins are rubbing off on the back glass surface.
dataset/train/77_40.wav|Kind of like sandpaper. But for the most part the marks can all be rubbed away. The dust from
dataset/train/77_41.wav|the softer metals is just getting caught on the microscopically rough surface of the edged glass.
dataset/train/77_42.wav|The camera lens, however, oops, is not made from glass.
dataset/train/77_43.wav|There are 4 cameras on this guy, the top being a 12 megapixel ultra wide with a few sensors. Then
dataset/train/77_44.wav|the impressive 108 megapixel wide angle. Then we have 2 telephoto cameras, one of which might
dataset/train/77_45.wav|be a periscope lens. It's kind of difficult to tell what's going on in there from the outside.
dataset/train/77_46.wav|There's really only one way to check. Ah. There it is. Indeed the bottom 100x zoom camera
dataset/train/77_47.wav|is once again a periscope unit. If you want to get your own Teardown Skin so you can see the insides
dataset/train/77_48.wav|of your phone from the outside, I'll leave a link down in the video description. The nice
dataset/train/77_49.wav|thing is that these Skins are temporary, so if you're ever headed to a funeral,
dataset/train/77_50.wav|just , and bam, you can get all bleak and depressing again whenever you want.
dataset/train/77_51.wav|The screen is where I think Samsung did make some solid improvements this year on the S21 Ultra.
dataset/train/77_52.wav|Not enough to get me to switch from my year and a half old Note 10 Plus, but still pretty cool.
dataset/train/77_53.wav|The 6.8 inch screen can do 1440p, with 120hz variable refresh rate. Basically,
dataset/train/77_54.wav|things look smoother and crisper than any other phone out on the market, all while conserving
dataset/train/77_55.wav|battery life. And it lasts for about 45 seconds under the heat from my lighter.
dataset/train/77_56.wav|Which are all very good and equally commendable attributes for a cellphone to have. Underneath
dataset/train/77_57.wav|the AMOLED display, which does not recover from the flames, is an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner,
dataset/train/77_58.wav|supposedly a tad larger this year, but we'll have to check that out from the inside.
dataset/train/77_59.wav|I'll scuff it up with some level 7 deeper grooves, and even with that damage, the fingerprint scanner
dataset/train/77_60.wav|can still read my fingerprint and unlock the phone every single time. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/77_61.wav|Now for the bend test. Samsung has always been super solid with their phones, even more so now
dataset/train/77_62.wav|with the extra metal around the contoured camera bump. And once again, the S21 Ultra is as solid as
dataset/train/77_63.wav|a rock, whether bent from the front or the back. I guess the real question is whether the $1,200 S21
dataset/train/77_64.wav|Ultra is worth buying. And I think that decision rests with the cameras. I took a quick trip to New
dataset/train/77_65.wav|York City to test out the camera. And you can see from these unedited video clips that the S21 Ultra
dataset/train/77_66.wav|is pretty exceptional with super detailed and crisp video capabilities. You're probably like,
dataset/train/77_67.wav|'Wow, Jerry, that's some really good footage. Ooo la la, really impressive. Ten out of ten.
dataset/train/77_68.wav|Exceptional low-light capabilities. But why are you traveling to New York during a pandemic?'
dataset/train/77_69.wav|And you're right. I actually just totally lied and all this footage you're seeing now just came from
dataset/train/77_70.wav|a Galaxy Note 4 from a video I filmed and posted to my YouTube channel over 6 years ago. Smartphone
dataset/train/77_71.wav|cameras have been really good for a really long time, so upgrading your phone just for the camera
dataset/train/77_72.wav|doesn't make a whole lot of sense...especially when the phones from 6 years ago can compete
dataset/train/77_73.wav|with the phones of today. And when the phones of today cost $1,200. You could go visit New York
dataset/train/77_74.wav|City in person for that price...after the pandemic of course. I'm going to hold off on upgrading for
dataset/train/77_75.wav|a little while longer. Flashy new phones are fun, but if you really do need a new phone,
dataset/train/77_76.wav|last year's model is always going to be cheaper and still has the SD card slot.
dataset/train/77_77.wav|Let me know what you think of the S21 Ultra down in the comments. Hit that subscribe
dataset/train/77_78.wav|button if you haven't already, and come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/77_79.wav|Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/78_1.wav|Today it's time for the Smartphone Durability Awards. It feels good to close out 2020. 2020
dataset/train/78_2.wav|has been pretty crazy, but it's also been really good. 2020 is the year that we launched
dataset/train/78_3.wav|The Rig – our Not A Wheelchair. It's been a pretty huge project for my wife and I. Dbrand
dataset/train/78_4.wav|and I also gave away 100 phones to you guys, and donated over 30 TV's to different hospitals
dataset/train/78_5.wav|and schools. We even built a school in Africa with your guys' help. That was back in January
dataset/train/78_6.wav|before the whole pandemic started. I also built a huge raised flower garden for my wife,
dataset/train/78_7.wav|and 3D printed a massive concrete statue of myself. And also got a close up look at some
dataset/train/78_8.wav|awesome new electric vehicles, and even installed some solar panels on the roof of my house...which
dataset/train/78_9.wav|I'll definitely be doing a follow up video on here in a few months. It's been a really
dataset/train/78_10.wav|big year. And of course, we've durability tested and torn down quite a few phones along
dataset/train/78_11.wav|the way, and today it's time for the 2020 Smartphone Durability Awards. Let's get started.
dataset/train/78_12.wav|Let's start with the most repairable smartphone of 2020, and that award goes to the Google
dataset/train/78_13.wav|Pixel 5, mostly because there are zero screws required to remove to replace the screen.
dataset/train/78_14.wav|A skilled technician could replace the screen on the Google Pixel 5 in about 60 seconds
dataset/train/78_15.wav|using just a heat plate, a suction cup, and a pry tool. Plus there's a layer between the
dataset/train/78_16.wav|screen and the internals so you don't damage any of the other fragile electronics while
dataset/train/78_17.wav|you're working around inside of there. It's pretty cool how Google was able to engineer
dataset/train/78_18.wav|such an easy screen replacement on the Google Pixel 5, so it wins the most repairable screen
dataset/train/78_19.wav|repair of 2020.
dataset/train/78_20.wav|The least repairable smartphone however, has got to go the Blackshark 3. This is actually
dataset/train/78_21.wav|kind of a funny story. My wife and I planned on doing like an April Fools video, and so
dataset/train/78_22.wav|she was the one who took this apart. We had no idea how difficult it was going to be.
dataset/train/78_23.wav|The different components of this phone are intertwined throughout the frame with multiple
dataset/train/78_24.wav|heat pipes and it's pretty crazy inside. She was a trooper through and she managed to put
dataset/train/78_25.wav|it all back together in one piece. But it's still the most difficult to repair smartphone
dataset/train/78_26.wav|of 2020.
dataset/train/78_27.wav|It was super difficult to pick the most innovative smartphone of 2020. You would think that during
dataset/train/78_28.wav|a pandemic the innovation would kind of slow down, but this has been one of the most fun
dataset/train/78_29.wav|years for smartphones we've had in a long time. One of my favorites has been the LG
dataset/train/78_30.wav|Wing, which has a screen on the front that opens up into like a “T” shape with a
dataset/train/78_31.wav|secondary screen underneath. It's something we never thought we wanted and probably still
dataset/train/78_32.wav|don't need, but it's still innovative and pretty cool.
dataset/train/78_33.wav|Then of course we have all the folding phones. This year they are much more durable and they
dataset/train/78_34.wav|have the glass layer underneath that plastic screen which is pretty cool. The most innovative
dataset/train/78_35.wav|smartphone of 2020 in my opinion has got to be the Axon 20 with its underscreen camera.
dataset/train/78_36.wav|Flippy screens are cool, fans are cool, but in the future most smartphones, I think, are
dataset/train/78_37.wav|going to be utilizing the technology that we first saw in this Axon 20. And as you know
dataset/train/78_38.wav|if you've been around on my channel for a while, we take apart every single smartphone
dataset/train/78_39.wav|to see what it looks like from the inside and how easy it is to repair. And the best
dataset/train/78_40.wav|looking smartphone of 2020, once again it was hard to choose, but in my opinion that
dataset/train/78_41.wav|has to go to the iPhone 12 Pro Max. It's hard to argue with the aesthetics of the MagSafe
dataset/train/78_42.wav|charger. Remember it uses those magnets around the wireless charging coil. The blend of the
dataset/train/78_43.wav|copper and the magnets just looks pretty good. Not to mention the special sensor shift up
dataset/train/78_44.wav|here in the top camera sensor. I don't always use “Apple” and “innovative” in the
dataset/train/78_45.wav|same sentence, but this year they've done a pretty good job with the iPhone. I do think
dataset/train/78_46.wav|that the Note 20 Ultra comes in a close second with this dual colored motherboard, but I
dataset/train/78_47.wav|still have to say that the best looking phone from the inside has got to be the iPhone 12
dataset/train/78_48.wav|Pro Max.
dataset/train/78_49.wav|Now, when we talk about the least durable smartphones of 2020, we kind of have a predicament
dataset/train/78_50.wav|because we have two categories of smartphones. We have the normal glass rectangles and it's
dataset/train/78_51.wav|pretty safe to say we have reasonable expectations of durability from these normal shaped smartphones.
dataset/train/78_52.wav|But this year, along with last year, we have a new category of folding phones, and that
dataset/train/78_53.wav|reasonable expectation of durability isn't the same since we're not really expecting
dataset/train/78_54.wav|a folding phone to be durable. Now they are much more durable than we initially anticipated...or
dataset/train/78_55.wav|at least for me. Bending the Galaxy Z Flip, or the Galaxy Fold in half is impossible with
dataset/train/78_56.wav|how sturdy their hinge is. But as far as the screen goes, it's still super soft and not
dataset/train/78_57.wav|as durable as a normal rectangular smartphone. So the folding phones get a pass for this
dataset/train/78_58.wav|year, but as they get more popular and more and more common, we'll start ranking them
dataset/train/78_59.wav|individually as well. They are still some of the most fun phones to take apart and see
dataset/train/78_60.wav|how they work. This is the Galaxy Z Flip. We have the Galaxy Fold right here, as well
dataset/train/78_61.wav|as the Moto RAZR which didn't get uh....he's just seen better days.
dataset/train/78_62.wav|Out of the smartphones that do have a reasonable expectation of durability, we have the Light
dataset/train/78_63.wav|Phone 2 that kind of snapped into little bits. It's super interesting to see the e-ink display
dataset/train/78_64.wav|is still lit even after being destroyed. That technology is super interesting. But the Light
dataset/train/78_65.wav|Phone 2 still isn't a real smartphone. The OnePlus Nord however did break entirely. The
dataset/train/78_66.wav|glass on the screen didn't crack and the glass on the back didn't crack, but the screen underneath
dataset/train/78_67.wav|the glass is destroyed, making the phone unusable after my durability test. So unfortunately
dataset/train/78_68.wav|the OnePlus Nord wins the least durable smartphone of 2020. It's not the award you want to win.
dataset/train/78_69.wav|Another award you don't want to win is a new one that I'm starting this year called The
dataset/train/78_70.wav|Delusive Award. We know that every smartphone manufacturer will hype up their devices as
dataset/train/78_71.wav|much as they can. You know, it's called marketing and everyone does it to some degree...Car
dataset/train/78_72.wav|manufacturers, people on dating apps, politicians, resumes...we all do it a little bit. But there
dataset/train/78_73.wav|is a point where that hype goes too far and steps into fantasy land. Samsung did toe the
dataset/train/78_74.wav|line with their folding glass on their folding phones this year, where the folding glass
dataset/train/78_75.wav|turned out to be a super tiny thin layer underneath all the layers of plastic. Delusive means
dataset/train/78_76.wav|kind of misleading, not entirely truthful. They also toed the line with their Exynos
dataset/train/78_77.wav|and Qualcomm fiasco. But there was a smartphone manufacturer that advertised over and over
dataset/train/78_78.wav|and over again that their smartphone had a 100% recycled aluminum encasing, which makes
dataset/train/78_79.wav|people think that the entire phone is made out of aluminum or has a metal body. When
dataset/train/78_80.wav|in reality that metal was a skeleton hidden underneath a very thick layer of plastic.
dataset/train/78_81.wav|Once again the advertising wasn't technically a lie, it was just creative enough that led
dataset/train/78_82.wav|people to think it was something else than what it was, hence the delusive part.
dataset/train/78_83.wav|The most delusive smartphone of 2020 was also the Google Pixel 5. You can see the super
dataset/train/78_84.wav|thick layer of plastic surrounding that metal skeleton that Google just conveniently didn't
dataset/train/78_85.wav|really mention. The Google Pixel 5 is also the most repairable smartphone of 2020, so
dataset/train/78_86.wav|you win some and you lose some. The delusive award is not an award you want to win and
dataset/train/78_87.wav|I hope I don't have to give it out next year.
dataset/train/78_88.wav|Now for the most durable smartphone of 2020. Most phones do survive my durability tests.
dataset/train/78_89.wav|Back in 2016 when I first started these durability awards, we had multiple phones snap in half.
dataset/train/78_90.wav|But most phones these days are very solidly constructed, rigid, and just generally well
dataset/train/78_91.wav|built smartphones. I can't say for certain if my videos helped in that quality improvement,
dataset/train/78_92.wav|but accountability is a good thing. Pretty much every smartphone released this year has
dataset/train/78_93.wav|glass on both sides and as we know, glass is glass and glass can break. And even though
dataset/train/78_94.wav|glass feels premium, it's never going to be durable, especially when companies like Apple
dataset/train/78_95.wav|are charging over $500 to replace the back glass on the iPhone 12 Pros. So I can't choose
dataset/train/78_96.wav|a glass backed phone to be the most durable. The most durable smartphone, naked, right
dataset/train/78_97.wav|out of the box, of 2020 has got to be the Pixel 4a. It's intentionally advertised as
dataset/train/78_98.wav|plastic, but it's still strong enough to withstand my durability test. And as a bonus it's designed
dataset/train/78_99.wav|in almost the same way as the Google Pixel 5 with it's super easy to swap screen. And
dataset/train/78_100.wav|if that wasn't enough, it's also one of the cheapest phones on this table as well as one
dataset/train/78_101.wav|of the few phones with a headphone jack. So the most durable smartphone of 2020 goes to
dataset/train/78_102.wav|the Google Pixel 4a. Now don't get me wrong, any of these smartphones on this table can
dataset/train/78_103.wav|be considered the most durable smartphone of 2020 if they have a case and a screen protector.
dataset/train/78_104.wav|The takeaway from these durability tests and teardowns are that most smartphones are really
dataset/train/78_105.wav|good, and if you treat them nice they are going to last for quite a while. So having
dataset/train/78_106.wav|protection on your phone is a good thing. It can save you hundreds of dollars down the
dataset/train/78_107.wav|road when you don't have to buy a new phone, because it's not broken.
dataset/train/78_108.wav|I used my last phone for about 3 years and I always had a case on it. And I've had this
dataset/train/78_109.wav|Galaxy Note 10 Plus for about a year now...a little over a year, and I have no intentions
dataset/train/78_110.wav|of upgrading in the near future. Because as smartphones get better, they stay relevant
dataset/train/78_111.wav|for longer.
dataset/train/78_112.wav|And that's it. The smartphone durability awards of 2020. We had some awesome phones this year
dataset/train/78_113.wav|and I'm excited to see what 2021 will bring us. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't
dataset/train/78_114.wav|already. As you can see we have quite a lot of phones around here. Come hang out with
dataset/train/78_115.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/79_1.wav|It's time to take a look at the world's first under display camera – from the
dataset/train/79_2.wav|inside. This Axon 20 5G has secrets that need revealing. It'll be interesting to see
dataset/train/79_3.wav|if our own mortal human eyes can peer through the transparent display once it's open,
dataset/train/79_4.wav|or if that's something only the camera can do. Let's get started.
dataset/train/79_5.wav|Getting inside the Axon 20 is pretty similar to other glass back smartphones. A lot of heat
dataset/train/79_6.wav|and gentle prying. Even though there's not an official water resistance rating on this guy,
dataset/train/79_7.wav|there is still a lot of glue. I can use my razor blade around the Noxv logo,
dataset/train/79_8.wav|taking special care not to put too much stress on the glass, since glass is glass and all.
dataset/train/79_9.wav|The back glass is pretty awesome...like a Nazgul dressing up for a work party.
dataset/train/79_10.wav|Finally, the back glass does come off. Having a good suction cup is always useful.
dataset/train/79_11.wav|And now that we're inside the phone I think my new screwdriver set is a bit of overkill since
dataset/train/79_12.wav|all I really need is a Phillips head. I'll put a link for this new toolkit down in the description.
dataset/train/79_13.wav|There are 20 screws holding down the back plastics. One of those screws is hidden
dataset/train/79_14.wav|up here under the NFC coil...which I'm 94% sure isn't supposed to be removed just yet.
dataset/train/79_15.wav|The interesting part of this phone though is that instead of just the rear plastics being removed,
dataset/train/79_16.wav|it's actually the whole back plastics and the side rails that come away from the screen in
dataset/train/79_17.wav|one piece – something that we don't see very often. ZTE is keeping us on our toes over here.
dataset/train/79_18.wav|The dual rear flash has some gold contact pads that just rest on top of the motherboard.
dataset/train/79_19.wav|We can unplug the battery just like a little Lego, and the bottom speaker can also come out
dataset/train/79_20.wav|at this point. It has some of those gold contact pads for communicating with the motherboard.
dataset/train/79_21.wav|The vibrator motor is one of those old school eccentric rotating mass
dataset/train/79_22.wav|motors from the olden days. But keep in mind that this phone is also only $450
dataset/train/79_23.wav|and still has some bleeding edge display tech. So we'll have to give this ancient vibrator a pass.
dataset/train/79_24.wav|There's a water damage indicator sticker next to the USB-C charging port.
dataset/train/79_25.wav|I'll unclip the side button ribbons, along with the two long extension ribbons over the battery.
dataset/train/79_26.wav|And unfortunately for us, the battery adhesive is still permanent and very strong. I can drip some
dataset/train/79_27.wav|isopropyl alcohol in here to dissolve the adhesive and make the removal easier, but it's still rather
dataset/train/79_28.wav|annoying. ZTE should be charging $450 and a penny on their next phone so they can afford to install
dataset/train/79_29.wav|those battery pull tabs. Eventually all phones do need to be recycled, and it's much harder to
dataset/train/79_30.wav|recycle them when extra steps are needed for the disassembly. And now everything under here is just
dataset/train/79_31.wav|slimy. Along with the new pull tabs they can also get rid of this 'battery not removable' message,
dataset/train/79_32.wav|since it obviously is still removable. Anyway, let's get back to finding that camera.
dataset/train/79_33.wav|The Axon 20 does have a copper vapor chamber under the battery, along with the ribbon for
dataset/train/79_34.wav|the display. I'll remove the two screws down here on the bottom board and unclip the underscreen
dataset/train/79_35.wav|fingerprint scanner. Then the charging port board can come loose. Nothing super interesting
dataset/train/79_36.wav|to see on this thing. The interesting part is the optical fingerprint scanner.
dataset/train/79_37.wav|The optical part means that it's also using a camera to look through
dataset/train/79_38.wav|the display to see the fingerprint that's pressed up against the glass.
dataset/train/79_39.wav|The top camera, the main under display camera, is a bit larger
dataset/train/79_40.wav|but it looks pretty much the same as every other selfie camera that we've seen over the years.
dataset/train/79_41.wav|We'll take a closer look in just a second, but first we have to unbury everything else.
dataset/train/79_42.wav|The underscreen earpiece is underneath this metal bracket. Once that's removed with it's two screws,
dataset/train/79_43.wav|the motherboard can come away from the phone revealing a lot of pink thermal paste
dataset/train/79_44.wav|and another strange warning symbol up here in the corner which looks like it's saying not to touch.
dataset/train/79_45.wav|I like though that this warning is on the underside of the motherboard
dataset/train/79_46.wav|so the only way to see the do not touch warning is by touching it to see what's underneath.
dataset/train/79_47.wav|The underscreen earpiece is an oversized tic-tac looking block that vibrates the display
dataset/train/79_48.wav|that transmitted sound to your ear. And then of course, we have the four rear cameras:
dataset/train/79_49.wav|the top 8 megapixel wide angle camera, the large 64 megapixel main sensor, the 2 megapixel depth
dataset/train/79_50.wav|camera, and the 2 megapixel macro camera, none of which have the optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/79_51.wav|Before I put the phone back together though, let's see if we can see through these displays.
dataset/train/79_52.wav|Remember, ZTE is using two different screens on the Axon 20,
dataset/train/79_53.wav|a tiny lower resolution square patch up at the top directly in front of the selfie camera,
dataset/train/79_54.wav|and then the rest of the screen is the normal 1080p full HD OLED. And if we set up my own
dataset/train/79_55.wav|camera to focus on my pry tool, we can peer through the top camera hole and clearly read
dataset/train/79_56.wav|'Jerry Rig Everything' with our own human eyes all right here through that display.
dataset/train/79_57.wav|It's got a kind of post-apocalyptic hue from the layers of the screen that we're looking through,
dataset/train/79_58.wav|but I'm sure the camera's software compensates for that discoloration after it takes the picture.
dataset/train/79_59.wav|An interesting thing is is that if we move the phone down to the bottom hole in the display
dataset/train/79_60.wav|for that underscreen fingerprint scanner, we can't see through the pixels anymore since those pixels
dataset/train/79_61.wav|are more dense. I guess seeing the ridges up close on our fingerprint doesn't require as much
dataset/train/79_62.wav|transparency as producing an actual colored image does. I think this is all pretty cool technology,
dataset/train/79_63.wav|even for a first generation version of an underscreen camera. It's pretty fun hanging
dataset/train/79_64.wav|out with all of you here and experiencing this history together. Feel free to leave a
dataset/train/79_65.wav|comment for your posterity to find in 50 years when they come back to see how it all started.
dataset/train/79_66.wav|Assuming, of course, that the world hasn't ended because smartphones were too hard to recycle.
dataset/train/79_67.wav|Getting the phone back and assembled like a dementor getting dressed in the morning.
dataset/train/79_68.wav|Everything still turns on and the camera still functions like normal. Nice work, ZTE.
dataset/train/79_69.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/79_70.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/8_1.wav|Today we're durability testing what's been called 'The World's Smartest Smartphone' – the Pixel 7
dataset/train/8_2.wav|Pro. Even though primarily focused on software, the latest phone from
dataset/train/8_3.wav|Google should be pretty interesting. Inside the box we get the phone itself
dataset/train/8_4.wav|with its absolute unit of a metal camera visor. I have some definite thoughts on
dataset/train/8_5.wav|this one. We also get a white USB-C cable and a cute little tiny booklet just for the
dataset/train/8_6.wav|SIM card removal tool. Creative. This video is sponsored by Audible. Let's get started.
dataset/train/8_7.wav|The biggest question I have with this new Pixel 7 Pro is how well this all-metal glossy camera
dataset/train/8_8.wav|cliff is going to hold up against scratches and daily use in my pocket. Nothing ages a phone or
dataset/train/8_9.wav|a vehicle faster than wear and tear on the paint job. Even out of the box for just a few minutes,
dataset/train/8_10.wav|the camera bump already has some scratches and my test hasn't even started yet. Hardware has never
dataset/train/8_11.wav|been the main focus of the Pixel phones. From both a component and structural perspective, software
dataset/train/8_12.wav|has always taken precedence. The Pixel 7 Pro is really no different. For example, for people who
dataset/train/8_13.wav|are hard of hearing, Google has an impressive list of accessibility tricks like live captions for any
dataset/train/8_14.wav|playing media, as well as live translation for that same media into 48 different languages. A
dataset/train/8_15.wav|pretty impressive feature to be sure. For people with visual impairments there is a TalkBack
dataset/train/8_16.wav|guided frame feature that we'll talk about with the cameras later on in this video.
dataset/train/8_17.wav|But first, the scratch test.
dataset/train/8_18.wav|Finding out what the screen is made from has always been the first phase of the
dataset/train/8_19.wav|JerryRigEverything durability tests for the past 7 years. It's been quite the journey as we work
dataset/train/8_20.wav|our way up through the Mohs scale of hardness. Some phones scratch at a level 2 like the Galaxy
dataset/train/8_21.wav|Flip. Some phones scratch at a level 8 or 9 like the DuraForce Ultra. But most phones,
dataset/train/8_22.wav|most phones my friends, scratch at level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. And this Pixel 7 Pro
dataset/train/8_23.wav|is no different. With Gorilla Glass Victus on top, the tempered glass is indeed scratch resistant.
dataset/train/8_24.wav|The glass also covers the 10.8 megapixel hole punch
dataset/train/8_25.wav|camera in the front which sits right below the super thin earpiece lid.
dataset/train/8_26.wav|The second phase of our durability test is finding out what the frame is made from.
dataset/train/8_27.wav|Sounds to me like we have some metal over here. A bit different than the thick layer of plastic
dataset/train/8_28.wav|we found on the Pixel 6A last year, and the Pixel 5 the year before. The non-glossy matte
dataset/train/8_29.wav|buttons are also made of metal which also has knowledge in the case with the Pixel phones.
dataset/train/8_30.wav|And up here at the top we have an ultra glossy plastic section and this is to let the 5G in.
dataset/train/8_31.wav|We have more metal along the left side near the IP68 SIM card tray which is designed to keep water
dataset/train/8_32.wav|out. And of course down at the bottom we have our loudspeaker, microphone, and 23 watt fast charging
dataset/train/8_33.wav|USB-C charging port. I italicized my voice because the 23 watts is actually pretty
dataset/train/8_34.wav|slow. Slower than even an iPhone. But hey, who's keeping track anymore anyway.
dataset/train/8_35.wav|Let's chat about that metal camera bump. There are a few ways to paint metal. Paint is one of those
dataset/train/8_36.wav|obviously, powder coating is another, but usually too thick for smartphones. And then we also have
dataset/train/8_37.wav|anodizing, which is accomplished by electrifying the metal in an acid bath. And while anodizing
dataset/train/8_38.wav|is indeed very durable since the metal itself is becoming the coating, it can still be worn
dataset/train/8_39.wav|down over time like on my very thinly anodized Rivian key fob that's only been in my pocket
dataset/train/8_40.wav|for about 6 months. To be completely fair, that fob also went through the washing machine once,
dataset/train/8_41.wav|but that's beside the point. The point is that no matter what the coating, constant abrasion
dataset/train/8_42.wav|will eventually wear through. Whether it's keys, coins, or 1,000 grit sandpaper that you might have
dataset/train/8_43.wav|rumbling around in your pocket, eventually the camera lens coating will rub off. And like we
dataset/train/8_44.wav|saw on the fob, even a cloth pocket is abrasive if you're patient enough. My prediction is that
dataset/train/8_45.wav|two years from now the Pixel 7 series of phones is going to aesthetically look pretty hammered
dataset/train/8_46.wav|more so than even the glass lens Pixel 6 phones released a whole year before. Unless, of course,
dataset/train/8_47.wav|you have a case that protects those raised anodized corners. Google has said that their
dataset/train/8_48.wav|phone frame is made from 100% recycled aluminum which is pretty awesome. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/8_49.wav|The biggest thumbs up, however, goes to a story that for some reason I just heard about
dataset/train/8_50.wav|for the first time. It's a true story called “The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind” that I've
dataset/train/8_51.wav|been listening to from my channel sponsor, Audibel. It's about a teenager from Malawi,
dataset/train/8_52.wav|Africa who made an electricity producing windmill with recycled bike parts and scrap
dataset/train/8_53.wav|metal to help save his family from a drought. And he did it all with information he found
dataset/train/8_54.wav|in a book. It's really a fantastic listen and makes you think outside the box. You,
dataset/train/8_55.wav|too, can listen to “The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind” and try Audible free for 30 days. Just
dataset/train/8_56.wav|head to Audible.com/JerryRig or text “jerryrig” to 500-500. Audible has everything from best sellers,
dataset/train/8_57.wav|memoirs, mysteries, motivations. Personally, my favorite type of audiobook are the true
dataset/train/8_58.wav|stories of people who have made a difference throughout history. And “The Boy Who Harnessed
dataset/train/8_59.wav|The Wind” with William Kumkwamba is definitely one of those stories. You can listen anytime,

dataset/train/8_63.wav|let me narrate something cool. Until then though, the link is down in the description.
dataset/train/8_64.wav|Where were we? Oh yes, the camera. Google has pretty much always been known for their good
dataset/train/8_65.wav|picture quality. We have the normal 50 megapixel camera on the left, then a 12 megapixel ultra wide
dataset/train/8_66.wav|in the center, and a 48 megapixel telephoto camera off in its own little circle – all protected with
dataset/train/8_67.wav|glass. Now it was about here when I noticed a slight deviation from what we normally see.
dataset/train/8_68.wav|My razorblade started leaving marks on the back glass. Both the neon green knife,
dataset/train/8_69.wav|as well as my transparent knife were both leaving scratches on the surface. Very strange. I thought
dataset/train/8_70.wav|about this phenomenon all while setting my fingerprint with the optical scanner under
dataset/train/8_71.wav|the front glass since both sides are protected with Victus and we don't normally see scratches
dataset/train/8_72.wav|from steel knife blades. However, my level 7 deeper grooves do leave some hefty damage on
dataset/train/8_73.wav|the front glass. And while the fingerprint scanner is still functional, the scratches are still a big
dataset/train/8_74.wav|deal. Moving my razor blade to the previous level 4 position, we can tell it's still leaving marks
dataset/train/8_75.wav|on the front. But the calibrated level 5 pick still does not, whether on the front or the back.
dataset/train/8_76.wav|Basically with the calibrated and standardized scratch test tools we see no damage. But with my
dataset/train/8_77.wav|uncalibrated razor blades, that very well could be an alloy of anything, changing from batch to
dataset/train/8_78.wav|batch and brand to brand. We do see some marks. Long story short, the scientific Mohs test says
dataset/train/8_79.wav|the glass is indeed normal. It's the razor blade alloy that probably has the variation. So I would
dataset/train/8_80.wav|indeed recommend against taking a razor blade to your phone. Thanks for watching Jerry Tech Tips.
dataset/train/8_81.wav|Flipping our very scratched Pixel 7 Pro over the front we can commence phase 3 – the burn test.
dataset/train/8_82.wav|Google has a 120 hertz 1440p 1500 bit display which has a very subtle glass curve around the
dataset/train/8_83.wav|edges. We see the pixels on the Pixel start to go black after about 20 seconds under the
dataset/train/8_84.wav|heat from my flame, and they very much do not recover. With the screen visually damaged you
dataset/train/8_85.wav|might be surprised to learn that as long as the touch function digitizer remains intact,
dataset/train/8_86.wav|the phone is still 100% usable, even if we were to burn every AMOLED pixel. People with visual
dataset/train/8_87.wav|impairments have been using software tricks like TalkBack to navigate smartphones for years. But
dataset/train/8_88.wav|Google has recently added a guided frame feature to the selfie camera that supposedly helps the
dataset/train/8_89.wav|phone find your face and guide the camera to the best position to take good selfies.
dataset/train/8_90.wav| One cropped face. Move your
dataset/train/8_91.wav|phone left and down. One face ready for selfie. 3, 2, 1, photo taken.
dataset/train/8_92.wav| ...even if the person is unable to visually see the screen during this
dataset/train/8_93.wav|process. I'm a pretty big fan of accessibility and I see this feature as a definite win.
dataset/train/8_94.wav| 3, 2, 1, photo taken. Tap. TalkBack off.
dataset/train/8_95.wav| Now for phase 4 – the bend test. Applying pressure to the back of the Pixel 7 Pro I found
dataset/train/8_96.wav|more flex than I was anticipating. This is a very heavy phone and now it has some definite curve
dataset/train/8_97.wav|right at that antenna line, next to the lower camera cliff. Enough curve that I legitimately
dataset/train/8_98.wav|thought that we were going to lose him with the first bend. Flipping the phone over and
dataset/train/8_99.wav|applying pressure to the front had no effect, but the back has some very unnerving flex. The
dataset/train/8_100.wav|Pixel 7 Pro does not snap in half nor break catastrophically, but Google is definitely
dataset/train/8_101.wav|snuggling up a little too close to that Nexus 6P standard of structural integrity. The visual gap
dataset/train/8_102.wav|in the antenna line means that this phone has definitely lost its water resistance. And while
dataset/train/8_103.wav|the Pixel 7 Pro does survive my durability test, it's only barely. So I would recommend a case with
dataset/train/8_104.wav|this smartphone for both structure as well as some aesthetic protection on the camera bump.
dataset/train/8_105.wav|A smartphone can last a really long time. And just like with brushing your teeth,
dataset/train/8_106.wav|a little help will allow them to last even longer.

dataset/train/80_1.wav|Today we have something super interesting: the world's first under display camera, right
dataset/train/80_2.wav|here on the Axon 20 5G...or is the 07 Noxv? So many new phones these days, and if you
dataset/train/80_3.wav|understood that reference you've probably been subscribed for too long. Right out of
dataset/train/80_4.wav|the box this thing looks pretty beastly, like some kind of super villain phone. I can see
dataset/train/80_5.wav|this hiding in Voldemort's pocket, or Darth Vader using it to play some Flappy Birds after
dataset/train/80_6.wav|blowing up Alderaan. I kind of like it. Let's get started.
dataset/train/80_7.wav|Inside the box we get our normal wall charger, USB-C power cord, and a free case. Protection
dataset/train/80_8.wav|is always a good thing. But seriously, this back is insane. I bet for sure this is how
dataset/train/80_9.wav|Sauron calls his mom. The coolest part of this phone though, and what we are here for
dataset/train/80_10.wav|is the front camera. The Axon 20 has a wall to wall bezel less display, no notch, and
dataset/train/80_11.wav|no motorized pop up camera. It still has a front facing camera hidden here somewhere.
dataset/train/80_12.wav|If I pull down the menu a little bit we can see that indeed the screen is notchless. But
dataset/train/80_13.wav|when I open up the camera it can still take my picture. Kind of mind blowing. The image
dataset/train/80_14.wav|quality is unique. Remember, this is a $450 smartphone, and all my lights have halos around
dataset/train/80_15.wav|them. But if I pull the camera back and take a normal selfie, it's not that bad. It's not
dataset/train/80_16.wav|as clean or crisp as the regular surface mounted camera, but remember, we are taking a picture
dataset/train/80_17.wav|through the screen and this is a first generation unit, so it's probably not going to be completely
dataset/train/80_18.wav|perfect.
dataset/train/80_19.wav|Side by side with my Note 10 Plus, we can see the quality difference. Remember though
dataset/train/80_20.wav|that the Axon 20 is half the price. The front camera is 32 megapixels which is quite a bit
dataset/train/80_21.wav|more pixels than we're used to seeing. And might be because the camera just needs more
dataset/train/80_22.wav|data to work with since it's capturing an image through so many screen layers. All of
dataset/train/80_23.wav|the stock backgrounds on the Axon 20 have a dark patch on the top of the screen, so
dataset/train/80_24.wav|I'm going to take my own picture with a white background so we can get a close up look at
dataset/train/80_25.wav|that see through display in action.
dataset/train/80_26.wav|If you remember, last year in the before times, I went and saw a transparent OLED TV made
dataset/train/80_27.wav|by LG, where when the pixels turn on they illuminate. But when they go black, they turn
dataset/train/80_28.wav|off and they are just gone. And it's transparent because the area around the pixels is clear.
dataset/train/80_29.wav|And if we look really closely we can see that ZTE is kind of doing the same thing, but has
dataset/train/80_30.wav|accomplished their transparency by actually using two different screens. The main screen
dataset/train/80_31.wav|takes up most of the phone's real estate, but there is a smaller, second lower resolution
dataset/train/80_32.wav|screen about the size of an ant that covers up the camera. And since it's lower resolution
dataset/train/80_33.wav|in this one tiny spot, it gives the camera more room between pixels to see through. But
dataset/train/80_34.wav|only when the display is black and the pixels are turned off. You can see the cool little
dataset/train/80_35.wav|screen effect that plays when I turn the front facing camera on, and how the camera can see
dataset/train/80_36.wav|through the glass screen when the OLED pixels are black or turned off. If the pixels were
dataset/train/80_37.wav|lit the camera behind the glass would obviously not work. Pretty fascinating and I think it
dataset/train/80_38.wav|works pretty well for a first generation device. I mean, if you're a professional Snapchatter
dataset/train/80_39.wav|or TicToker, this might not be the best camera for you. But for a sub $500 phone shooting
dataset/train/80_40.wav|through the screen, I think it's pretty darn good.
dataset/train/80_41.wav|The square patch is semi obvious when we're zoomed in up close in 4K resolution. But if
dataset/train/80_42.wav|we back up to a normal perspective it does disappear and blend into the rest of the screen
dataset/train/80_43.wav|pretty well. When we're watching a full screen video, that ant sized patch of low resolution
dataset/train/80_44.wav|OLED pixels are basically unnoticeable. They are working just as hard as their higher resolution
dataset/train/80_45.wav|counterparts on the rest of the screen. And if I'm being honest, I kind of like this transparent
dataset/train/80_46.wav|display better than a notch or a hole punch. I'm a fan of where this technology is headed.
dataset/train/80_47.wav|We'll get back to the front camera more in just a second, but first let's see what the
dataset/train/80_48.wav|rest of the Axon 20 is made of. For a $450 phone, I've been impressed so far. Just like
dataset/train/80_49.wav|usual we use the Mohs scale of hardness to check the screen. And, just like usual, we
dataset/train/80_50.wav|start seeing scratches at a level 6, with deeper groves at a level 7. ZTE has made everything
dataset/train/80_51.wav|go under the display this time around, including the earpiece. We've seen underscreen earpiece
dataset/train/80_52.wav|technology before, like in the Pixel 5, but it is pretty cool to see one brand implementing
dataset/train/80_53.wav|all of the underscreen technologies in one phone.
dataset/train/80_54.wav|Up close and personal again with that camera square, at some angles it stands out more
dataset/train/80_55.wav|than others. And if we hold it just right, we can almost see the camera unit itself behind
dataset/train/80_56.wav|the glass. Still protected from scratching, of course.
dataset/train/80_57.wav|The sides of the Axon 20 5G are made from plastic, along with the top of the phone.
dataset/train/80_58.wav|No headphone jack here. And there is more plastic running down the other side. Once
dataset/train/80_59.wav|we get to the bottom of the phone there is more plastic yet again. There is nothing wrong
dataset/train/80_60.wav|with plastic of course, but it does make you wonder how it will hold up during the bend
dataset/train/80_61.wav|test.
dataset/train/80_62.wav|There is a SIM and SD card slot, but no official IP rating. Flipping the phone over you can
dataset/train/80_63.wav|see once again that this is totally a phone Loki would call an Uber with – evil, yet
dataset/train/80_64.wav|stylish. The Noxv logo on the bottom corner is covered with glass, along with the 4 unit
dataset/train/80_65.wav|camera lens. The 2 megapixel macro camera down at the bottom, then a 2 megapixel depth
dataset/train/80_66.wav|camera, 64 megapixel main camera, and finally an 8 megapixel wide angle camera up top with
dataset/train/80_67.wav|it's single color dual LED flash.
dataset/train/80_68.wav|Speaking of putting everything beneath the screen, the Axon 20 has an optical underscreen
dataset/train/80_69.wav|fingerprint scanner. Once I get that all good and scratched up at level 7 deeper grooves,
dataset/train/80_70.wav|it can still read and unlock my fingerprint every single time. Thumbs up for that. I think
dataset/train/80_71.wav|we should get one more close up look at this inside second screen, just in case this is
dataset/train/80_72.wav|our last chance since not every phone survives the bend test. It's mostly invisible when
dataset/train/80_73.wav|looking at the phone head on. But at certain angles in super bright light, we can peer
dataset/train/80_74.wav|into its depths.
dataset/train/80_75.wav|Fire is also sometimes associated with evil, which is perfect because I do happen to have
dataset/train/80_76.wav|some fire. The 6.9 inch 1080p display on the Axon 20 is 10 bit, which means it has way
dataset/train/80_77.wav|more colors than your average iPhone or Samsung. And it lasts about 13 seconds under the heat
dataset/train/80_78.wav|from my lighter, but still mostly recovers. And since I know some of you want to know
dataset/train/80_79.wav|what happens when I burn the baby screen up top, we'll go ahead and try that as well.
dataset/train/80_80.wav|It is an evil phone. After about 10 seconds we get the same pulsing lights, and even though
dataset/train/80_81.wav|it does recover, that burn makes the secondary screen a bit more visible. So it might be
dataset/train/80_82.wav|a good idea to leave the villain phone top side if you're ever visiting Hades in the
dataset/train/80_83.wav|underworld.
dataset/train/80_84.wav|Finally, the bend test. The Axon 20 is a large phone with plastic sides, and does flex a
dataset/train/80_85.wav|bit with the bend test, but does not crack or break, even when bent from the opposite
dataset/train/80_86.wav|direction. Not too shabby. The Axon 20 5G passes my durability test. I'm curious, would
dataset/train/80_87.wav|you rather have an underscreen camera, or a notch on your next phone? Let me know down
dataset/train/80_88.wav|in the comments. Either way, I think it's a safe bet that we're going to see a lot more
dataset/train/80_89.wav|of this underscreen camera stuff in the future. It'll probably show up in some sketchy products
dataset/train/80_90.wav|as well as Apple being very excited when they invent it in 3 or 4 years. But I look forward
dataset/train/80_91.wav|to that.
dataset/train/80_92.wav|Hit that subscribe button so you don't miss the teardown. We're going to see that camera
dataset/train/80_93.wav|from the inside. And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for
dataset/train/80_94.wav|watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/81_1.wav|Sometimes calling a phone “dumb” can be a compliment, especially if that's the kind
dataset/train/81_2.wav|of phone you are looking for. This little guy I have on my desk today is called the
dataset/train/81_3.wav|Light Phone 2. And like usual, we're going to find out if the Light phone is a lightweight.
dataset/train/81_4.wav|Supposedly this is one of those simple minimalist phones that only do a few things so you can
dataset/train/81_5.wav|reduce the amount of time spent staring at a screen, which of course, is a healthy desire.
dataset/train/81_6.wav|But the unhealthy part of all of this is that the Light phone still costs $300. And I don't
dataset/train/81_7.wav|know about you, but if I'm spending $300 on something, it better do some things...like
dataset/train/81_8.wav|more than one.
dataset/train/81_9.wav|The phone itself is very small, thin, and well, light. Let's get started.
dataset/train/81_10.wav|You might have noticed by now that the Light phone's screen is a bit different. Instead
dataset/train/81_11.wav|of an AMOLED or LCD, this guy is an E Ink display, like an ereader or a Kindle. Meaning
dataset/train/81_12.wav|it has two colors: black and white. And a refresh rate of whenever I feel like it, which
dataset/train/81_13.wav|is usually after a button press or something. Right off the bat I can tell the vibrator
dataset/train/81_14.wav|is pretty loosy-goosy. See if you can hear it. It's like a couple of rocks in a tin can.
dataset/train/81_15.wav|It does have a full blown corded keyboard for sending text messages, but no email or
dataset/train/81_16.wav|spell check. It's got an alarm capability, and even a few ringtones to choose from.
dataset/train/81_17.wav|And that's about it. No cameras, no internet, and probably no way of surviving what's coming.
dataset/train/81_18.wav|But let's keep going.
dataset/train/81_19.wav|The Light Phone 2 has that electric paper, E Ink screen, that's just shy of 3 inches.
dataset/train/81_20.wav|At first glance and first touch I thought the screen might be made of plastic, which
dataset/train/81_21.wav|usually scratches at a level 2 or 3. But it turns out that it's using a frosted roughed
dataset/train/81_22.wav|up glass layer that's acting like sandpaper to my Mohs hardness tools. You can see the
dataset/train/81_23.wav|markings at levels 3, 4, and 5. These aren't scratches though – just permanent dust streaks
dataset/train/81_24.wav|from my picks. This means that the screen is still pretty resilient from actual physical
dataset/train/81_25.wav|damage, but if left alone with your keys or coins it's going to get superficially scuffed
dataset/train/81_26.wav|up in a way that's difficult to clean.
dataset/train/81_27.wav|There is no front facing camera on the Light Phone 2, nor can it receive picture messages.
dataset/train/81_28.wav|It's got the front proximity sensors and an earpiece grill below the glass and screen
dataset/train/81_29.wav|layer that won't be falling out on it's own. The sides of the phone are made from plastic,
dataset/train/81_30.wav|along with the volume buttons that are placed on either side of the menu button. You can
dataset/train/81_31.wav|see the screen flash white every now and then. This is how the E Ink screen refreshes itself,
dataset/train/81_32.wav|but I'll explain more about that in a second.
dataset/train/81_33.wav|The top of the phone has a headphone jack and power button. And there's a whopping total
dataset/train/81_34.wav|of 1 gigabyte of on-board storage for music. We do have an unlocked SIM card tray, but
dataset/train/81_35.wav|no additional expandable memory. One gig is all you get.
dataset/train/81_36.wav|Then down here at the bottom we have the blast from the past micro USB port, which most smartphones
dataset/train/81_37.wav|started phasing out about 3 years ago. Then the back of the phone still has no camera
dataset/train/81_38.wav|and appears to be made from plastic. The Light logo on the back is a built-in part of the
dataset/train/81_39.wav|panel and won't be falling out on it's own.
dataset/train/81_40.wav|Fun fact, there's actually been a light bulb burning in Livermore California almost nonstop
dataset/train/81_41.wav|for the past 117 years. It's called the Centennial Light. Most of the wear and tear on light
dataset/train/81_42.wav|bulbs comes from turning them off and on and not just by leaving them lit. LED bulbs of
dataset/train/81_43.wav|course last about 50 times longer than a normal incandescent. But still, 117 years is very
dataset/train/81_44.wav|impressive. Congrats to Livermore California.
dataset/train/81_45.wav|Speaking of lights, let's talk about the screen. We've never burned an E Ink display before.
dataset/train/81_46.wav|Each pixel only has two colors, black and white, and can flash back and forth between
dataset/train/81_47.wav|the two. But the screen doesn't use power to maintain what state that pixel is left
dataset/train/81_48.wav|in, like a normal AMOLED or LCD would. It's kind of like an Etch-a-Sketch, once it is
dataset/train/81_49.wav|that color it stays that color until it's refreshed. You can see as I flip through the
dataset/train/81_50.wav|screens, there's also a bright flash of all the pixels switching to their new orientation.
dataset/train/81_51.wav|And sometimes there's a bit of ghosting from what was left on the screen before it. But
dataset/train/81_52.wav|interestingly enough, even after 50 seconds of burning, the E Ink display appears to have
dataset/train/81_53.wav|no damage. The faint ghosting you see over the entire screen is just one of those quirks
dataset/train/81_54.wav|of E Ink and doesn't have anything to do with the fire. Everything, surprisingly, still
dataset/train/81_55.wav|works. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/81_56.wav|Now, realistically with a phone this small, it will most likely always be in a front pocket.
dataset/train/81_57.wav|But for kicks and giggles, if you were ever to put it in your back pocket things might
dataset/train/81_58.wav|get a bit dangerous...for both the phone and your bum. As we can see, the phone screen
dataset/train/81_59.wav|is indeed made of glass with cracks running along the entire surface. And now only the
dataset/train/81_60.wav|bottom strip of the screen below that crack is still working. The Light Phone 2 does not
dataset/train/81_61.wav|survive the bend test. It is interesting that the portion above the crack is still frozen
dataset/train/81_62.wav|in it's last state before breaking. The E Ink never had a chance to refresh or clear
dataset/train/81_63.wav|itself, so it's just permanently in that position now. And since we're already this far, we
dataset/train/81_64.wav|might as well just see what else is inside this little guy.
dataset/train/81_65.wav|Now, initially I thought the whole back housing might just pop off like we've seen on some
dataset/train/81_66.wav|other cheaper Android phones. And even though I was successful in my use of brute force,
dataset/train/81_67.wav|this turned out to be the wrong way to open it up, and I'll show you why in just a second.
dataset/train/81_68.wav|With the plastic back housing forcibly removed, we can see that the screen is glued to a battery
dataset/train/81_69.wav|and mid frame sandwich, and the correct way to take apart the phone would have been to
dataset/train/81_70.wav|remove the screen first, with heat and gentle prying and then unscrew some screws. It's
dataset/train/81_71.wav|interesting that even now, with the E Ink screen completely detached from the phone,
dataset/train/81_72.wav|it's still displaying its final frame, even though both screen ribbons are ripped completely
dataset/train/81_73.wav|off.
dataset/train/81_74.wav|I'll remove the two Phillips head screws and unclip the ribbons just like a little Lego.
dataset/train/81_75.wav|One is for the display, the other is probably for the digitizer. The back of the mid frame
dataset/train/81_76.wav|sandwich has the battery. This is gently adhered to the back of the motherboard, and is 950
dataset/train/81_77.wav|milliamp hours, which is about 3x the capacity of the Apple watch. I'll pop off the two black
dataset/train/81_78.wav|plastic end caps, and then if we look closely we can see that there is a Phillips head screw
dataset/train/81_79.wav|in each of the four corners. And still attached to these screws is a gold threaded insert.
dataset/train/81_80.wav|Normally these inserts are embedded into the plastic frame and give something solid for
dataset/train/81_81.wav|the screw to grip onto when they're assembling the phone. But since I man-handled it out
dataset/train/81_82.wav|of the housing with force instead of finesse, it just wants to spin freely on the screw.
dataset/train/81_83.wav|Let's pretend I did all that ripping apart on purpose to show you what the screw inserts
dataset/train/81_84.wav|look like...you know, for educational purposes.
dataset/train/81_85.wav|Once all the inserts are pulled off the screws, I can separate the mid frame from the motherboard.
dataset/train/81_86.wav|And it does have some copper sheeting on it which is nice. I'm glad to see that the $300
dataset/train/81_87.wav|are being put to good use. Gotta keep the phone cool while the...alarm clock goes off,
dataset/train/81_88.wav|and the screen refreshes twice a minute. This phone's working as hard as the White House
dataset/train/81_89.wav|during a pandemic. Good thing help is finally on the way. The motherboard has the headphone
dataset/train/81_90.wav|jack, front facing proximity sensors, earpiece speaker on the back, and the microphone and
dataset/train/81_91.wav|micro USB port down on the bottom. And of course, our loosy-goosy coin style vibration
dataset/train/81_92.wav|motor in the plastic bit. I mean, I think the Light Phone is kind of a fun idea, it
dataset/train/81_93.wav|can also be it's own WiFi hotspot, and it's definitely a step above the NoPhone. And I
dataset/train/81_94.wav|also think that people really are addicted to their smartphones these days. And we know
dataset/train/81_95.wav|that smartphones don't bring happiness. So I guess if money isn't an issue and you have
dataset/train/81_96.wav|$300 to burn, you can always snag a Light Phone, even if it will probably end up decorating
dataset/train/81_97.wav|your shelf 20 minutes after you fail your tech detox. If you're really serious about
dataset/train/81_98.wav|wanting to cut back on doomsday scrolling though, they still do sell flip phones for
dataset/train/81_99.wav|super cheap and maybe one of those is a better option.
dataset/train/81_100.wav|Either way though, let me know what you think down in the comments. Come hang out with me
dataset/train/81_101.wav|on Instagram and Twitter...unless, of course, you have a Light Phone. And thanks a ton for
dataset/train/81_102.wav|watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/82_1.wav|This Google Pixel 5 has been through quite a lot. We found that it's got a rather strong cocoon of
dataset/train/82_2.wav|plastic surrounding a metal subframe. And we also got a peek inside of this subframe during the
dataset/train/82_3.wav|durability test, since it's not completely 100% metal. There's a hole for that wireless charging.
dataset/train/82_4.wav|Today we'll be taking apart the whole thing. When I stabbed the battery there was a short, sparks,
dataset/train/82_5.wav|and a small fire, but surprisingly it looks like the battery has stabilized enough to power the
dataset/train/82_6.wav|Pixel 5 back on. Which is rather incredible since I was not very gentle with it at all during the
dataset/train/82_7.wav|durability test. The Pixel 5 has withstood over 1000 degrees and an hour long bath in acetone,
dataset/train/82_8.wav|so it kind of can be forgiven for the touch sensitivity not working anymore. I mean it's
dataset/train/82_9.wav|worse off than Anakin was in the Prequels, so I'm just impressed it turned on at all.
dataset/train/82_10.wav|Anyway, let's get started.
dataset/train/82_11.wav|An interesting thing about the outside of the Pixel 5 is that there are no screws.
dataset/train/82_12.wav|Nothing is holding the phone closed except for the IP68 adhesive surrounding the screen.
dataset/train/82_13.wav|I'll remove the SIM card tray and then use my razor blade to slice in between
dataset/train/82_14.wav|the screen's plastic bumper layer, and the phone's bio-resin layer, working my way
dataset/train/82_15.wav|gently around the edge so the phone doesn't get damaged...since nobody likes a scratched phone.
dataset/train/82_16.wav|Once the screen is folded open like a book, we see that this actually might be the easiest screen
dataset/train/82_17.wav|replacement of all time, with no screw driver required for anything. The metal plate holding
dataset/train/82_18.wav|down the screen ribbon is just a little latch, and then the screen ribbon can be popped off just
dataset/train/82_19.wav|like a little Lego. The Google Pixel 5 really does have the easiest screen replacement of all time.
dataset/train/82_20.wav|With just a hot plate, a suction cup and a pry tool, I bet a skilled repair tech could swap
dataset/train/82_21.wav|the screen in about 60 seconds if enough caffeine was involved. Nice work, Google.
dataset/train/82_22.wav|The large square underscreen earpiece is adhered to the back of the display. It's got two contact
dataset/train/82_23.wav|points that rest on the motherboard. And then the speaker vibrates the surface of the screen
dataset/train/82_24.wav|to transmit audio through the glass. Kind of fun and also makes for one less hole to waterproof.
dataset/train/82_25.wav|There are 12 screws holding down the large thick metal plate over the motherboard.
dataset/train/82_26.wav|I'll link the toolkit that I'm using in the video description if you're curious.
dataset/train/82_27.wav|The battery has some black graphite tape on top,
dataset/train/82_28.wav|and then the thick metal plate can come loose. Down near the bottom is a small white damage
dataset/train/82_29.wav|indicator sticker, which apparently isn't triggered by acetone. Or maybe the phone was
dataset/train/82_30.wav|just water-resistant enough to keep the acetone out...which is kind of crazy. Either way though,
dataset/train/82_31.wav|I'll put the sticker back into place cuz I don't want to risk voiding my warranty.
dataset/train/82_32.wav|I'll unplug the battery just like a little Lego, and then we can move to the top of the phone and
dataset/train/82_33.wav|remove the two rear cameras. Regular sized little guys. The 12.2 megapixel normal camera does have
dataset/train/82_34.wav|optical image stabilization, while the 16 megapixel ultra wide angle camera does not.
dataset/train/82_35.wav|Now, there is one more screw holding down the top left of the motherboard. But strangely,
dataset/train/82_36.wav|even though after removing that screw, the motherboard doesn't come out of the phone
dataset/train/82_37.wav|because the battery is resting partially on top of the board.
dataset/train/82_38.wav|It's a strange design choice that we haven't seen before. I don't immediately see any magic pull
dataset/train/82_39.wav|tabs, but with a bit of forceful persuasion the battery can be lifted up and out of the
dataset/train/82_40.wav|phone. We can get our first look at the back side where it received the poke of doom through
dataset/train/82_41.wav|the wireless charging hole. The outer shell of the battery is a bit melted from the sparks.
dataset/train/82_42.wav|The warning label, which to be fair can't be read from outside of the phone, does say “do not open,
dataset/train/82_43.wav|crush, or heat.” And I kind of did all those things. So the fire was kind of deserved.
dataset/train/82_44.wav|With the battery out we can now remove the motherboard. It's got a non removable USB-C
dataset/train/82_45.wav|charging port at the bottom with it's red rubber ring, as well as a waterproofing gasket over the
dataset/train/82_46.wav|microphone opening. The fingerprint scanning ribbon is also connected to the side buttons.
dataset/train/82_47.wav|Personally, I think the wireless charging coil looks pretty cool.
dataset/train/82_48.wav|One of my favorite clear phones of all time was the old Pixel 3 a few years ago.
dataset/train/82_49.wav|Now that the insides are out, we can see through the hole in this Pixel 5 through
dataset/train/82_50.wav|the large u-shaped cutout in the middle. Which is quite a bit larger than the charging coil itself.
dataset/train/82_51.wav|It's mostly all still covered up with the bio-resin exterior that I left intact.
dataset/train/82_52.wav|Overall, I think that the Pixel 5 is a very durable phone. Plastic, or bio-resin in this case,
dataset/train/82_53.wav|is resilient, especially when combined with its metal core. I just think that Google should,
dataset/train/82_54.wav|you know, own it a little bit more. If you tell the truth in your online dating profile,
dataset/train/82_55.wav|you'll end up in happier relationships since the truth always comes out eventually.
dataset/train/82_56.wav|Huge thumbs up to the Pixel 5 for sputtering to life earlier in the video. But with a stabbed
dataset/train/82_57.wav|battery, it's time to put her down for good so she doesn't explode later. You know, taking out
dataset/train/82_58.wav|your insides and putting them on your outsides is usually rather detrimental from a lifespan
dataset/train/82_59.wav|point of view. But an easy and safe way to show off your internals is with a Teardown Skin.
dataset/train/82_60.wav|When paired with a grip case it's actually rather beneficial...from a lifespan point of view.
dataset/train/82_61.wav|The easiest way to replace your screen is actually never having to replace it in the first place. So
dataset/train/82_62.wav|I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skin and case in the video description. And let's hope that Google
dataset/train/82_63.wav|is a bit more clear with their advertising next time around. Nobody likes a catfish.
dataset/train/82_64.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/82_65.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/83_1.wav|On the Google Pixel 5's website, this phone is advertised as having a 100% recycled aluminum
dataset/train/83_2.wav|enclosure, a 100% aluminum encasing, and as having a water-resistant metal body...which
dataset/train/83_3.wav|logically leads most tech websites and tech YouTubers to parrot that same information,
dataset/train/83_4.wav|since, you know, we trust the manufacturers. We know though that the Pixel 5 has wireless
dataset/train/83_5.wav|charging and wireless charging doesn't work through metal. So the Pixel 5 on paper is
dataset/train/83_6.wav|breaking the laws of physics. Today it's time to see what the Pixel 5 is really made of
dataset/train/83_7.wav|and how that wireless charging action actually works.
dataset/train/83_8.wav|This video is sponsored by Audible. Let's get started.
dataset/train/83_9.wav|For a flagship, this Google Pixel 5 is actually surprisingly inexpensive at just $649. It's
dataset/train/83_10.wav|half the price of other top phones like Apple and Samsung. And I do take that into consideration
dataset/train/83_11.wav|during my review. You get what you pay for and if it costs half as much, you can expect
dataset/train/83_12.wav|half as much. Plus, Google has never really tried to compete in the hardware specs because
dataset/train/83_13.wav|they are mostly about the software experience. That being said though, clear advertising
dataset/train/83_14.wav|is important across the board...whether a phone costs $6 or $600.
dataset/train/83_15.wav|The 6 inch screen is made from Gorilla Glass 6, so we start seeing scratches at a level
dataset/train/83_16.wav|6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. The front screen also contains that 8 megapixel front
dataset/train/83_17.wav|facing hole punch camera, as well as no speaker grill. The Google Pixel 5 seems to have an
dataset/train/83_18.wav|underscreen speaker, which we have seen in some other phones. And it'll be pretty interesting
dataset/train/83_19.wav|to see what it looks like from the inside when we get to the teardown.
dataset/train/83_20.wav|Now, nowhere on Google's website does it say that the Pixel 5's exterior is a layer of
dataset/train/83_21.wav|plastic. Remember, they call it "metal" three different times. But we can see by the ease
dataset/train/83_22.wav|at which my razorblade slices through the phone
dataset/train/83_23.wav|that there is indeed copious amounts of plastic on the backside. We have to go pretty darn
dataset/train/83_24.wav|deep before we find any shiny metal. Google has told other websites that the phone is
dataset/train/83_25.wav|covered in a bio-resin, which is a plant based polymer, or a more eco-friendly plastic. They
dataset/train/83_26.wav|just don't mention that anywhere on their own web page which I think is a missed opportunity
dataset/train/83_27.wav|since bio-resin actually sounds pretty cool and would make for a good selling point on
dataset/train/83_28.wav|the Pixel 5.
dataset/train/83_29.wav|The volume rocker is plastic, but the power button is metal. We can see how thick the
dataset/train/83_30.wav|plastic is by cutting a v-shaped groove into the top of the phone through that bio-resin
dataset/train/83_31.wav|layer. And we see that basically the whole curve of the phone is plastic all the way
dataset/train/83_32.wav|down to the screen. And it's the same thing on every single side.
dataset/train/83_33.wav|The SIM card tray has no expandable memory, but the phone is IP68 and has USB-C charging.
dataset/train/83_34.wav|There is no headphone jack. The "G" on the back panel is inlayed into the plastic itself.
dataset/train/83_35.wav|Kind of like we saw on the back of the plastic Nexus 5 back in 2013. The letters on that
dataset/train/83_36.wav|phone had a history of falling out over time. Let's hope Google is using some stronger glue
dataset/train/83_37.wav|this time around.
dataset/train/83_38.wav|There are 2 cameras on the back: a 12.2 megapixel normal camera, and a 16 megapixel ultrawide.
dataset/train/83_39.wav|Google cameras have been accepted as some of the best smartphones across the board for
dataset/train/83_40.wav|quite a while now, even if they don't have that telephoto option.
dataset/train/83_41.wav|Before we dive in and see how the wireless charging works, let's test the fingerprint
dataset/train/83_42.wav|scanner. It's on the backside of the phone so it's more of a fingerprint than a thumbprint,
dataset/train/83_43.wav|and has a much faster setup time than the underscreen fingerprint scanners have. And
dataset/train/83_44.wav|once it's been damaged considerably, it still recognizes and unlocks the phone with my fingerprint
dataset/train/83_45.wav|every single time. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/83_46.wav|Now, for the wireless charging. If my estimates are correct, the wireless charger should be
dataset/train/83_47.wav|in this general area. And don't get me wrong, I have nothing against plastic. The bio-resin
dataset/train/83_48.wav|on this Pixel 5 does seem durable. It won't be scratching or chipping on its own. It's
dataset/train/83_49.wav|much harder than the LG G5's coating we saw a few years ago. I definitely don't take issue
dataset/train/83_50.wav|with plastic. The only thing I take issue with is Google calling it metal three times
dataset/train/83_51.wav|on their website with no mention of plastic or bio-resin anywhere. They had no problem
dataset/train/83_52.wav|calling the Pixel 4a plastic, and clearly this Pixel 5 has just as much plastic on it
dataset/train/83_53.wav|as that 4a does. It just keeps going. It really does just keep going.
dataset/train/83_54.wav|Finally, we get a glimpse of some copper underneath the bio-resin layer. These are the 12 watt
dataset/train/83_55.wav|wireless charging copper coils that can reverse wireless charge other devices at 5 watts...all
dataset/train/83_56.wav|sitting here underneath that thick plastic layer. And if we watch really closely we can
dataset/train/83_57.wav|learn by accident that the battery is right below that wireless charging coil. Batteries
dataset/train/83_58.wav|and sharp objects don't go well together. And now the phone is dead. Let's watch it
dataset/train/83_59.wav|one more time in slow motion just for fun since that was really expensive.
dataset/train/83_60.wav|Now, if the phone really was made from metal like Google was advertising, that would not
dataset/train/83_61.wav|have happened. I'm sure there is more metal in other parts of the phone though. It might
dataset/train/83_62.wav|just not be in this specific location. So let's pull out some science and see if we
dataset/train/83_63.wav|can dissolve some of this plastic. I always keep some acetone around. It's a clear, colorless,
dataset/train/83_64.wav|flammable solvent. I use it to clean metal before welding. But it's also good at dissolving
dataset/train/83_65.wav|some plastics, rubber, and adhesive, as well as paint. We'll just let the phone marinate
dataset/train/83_66.wav|in this acetone for about an hour and see what happens.
dataset/train/83_67.wav|While you're watching the time lapse, let me tell you about an audio book that helped
dataset/train/83_68.wav|me understand the world of social media before I ever got into it. Huge thanks to Audible
dataset/train/83_69.wav|for sponsoring this video. Ready Player Two is pretty good by the way. Not as good as
dataset/train/83_70.wav|Ready Player One, but I still like it. But yeah, the audiobook that helped me understand
dataset/train/83_71.wav|social media when I started my YouTube channel 8 years ago is called Platform. So if you're
dataset/train/83_72.wav|trying to start your own business or grow an audience online during the craziness of
dataset/train/83_73.wav|2020, this might be a good place to start your learning. You can get your first audio
dataset/train/83_74.wav|book for free by going to Audible.com/jerryrig. Or texting "jerryrig" to 500-500. And you
dataset/train/83_75.wav|can be listening to your audio book within a matter of minutes. I find that listening
dataset/train/83_76.wav|is a great way to multitask while doing other activities. Audible has rolled out its newest
dataset/train/83_77.wav|membership plan Audible Plus. And with the holidays upon us, Audible is offering this
dataset/train/83_78.wav|new plan for just $4.95 a month for the first 6 months. And after that it's just $7.95.
dataset/train/83_79.wav|Audible.com/jerryrig or text "jerryrig" to 500-500. I'll leave a link down in the video
dataset/train/83_80.wav|description.
dataset/train/83_81.wav|Now that time lapse really was about 50 minutes long. And honestly I thought it would do something
dataset/train/83_82.wav|more to the phone, but it turns out that acetone mostly only affects PVC and polystyrene, which
dataset/train/83_83.wav|are more common forms of plastic. But acetone does not affect bio-resins. And that bio-resin
dataset/train/83_84.wav|is just as strong now as it was when I first put it into the solvent. But no fear, we still
dataset/train/83_85.wav|have other options. I'll grab a plate from the kitchen, don't tell my wife, and if I
dataset/train/83_86.wav|use a heat gun, which can get up to about 1,000 degrees fahrenheit, we can heat up that
dataset/train/83_87.wav|plastic. The glass plate is here so my desk doesn't start on fire.
dataset/train/83_88.wav|Once that bio-resin is warmed up, it's much easier to peel off the phone, which reveals
dataset/train/83_89.wav|a metal subframe below the plastic. This subframe must be that 100% recycled aluminum that Google
dataset/train/83_90.wav|mentions on their website. It also has some additional cutouts near the bottom for what
dataset/train/83_91.wav|I assume is the antennas. Personally, I think that Google Pixel was metal in the same way
dataset/train/83_92.wav|my body is bone. Metal provides a structure, but it's definitely not what's on the outside.
dataset/train/83_93.wav|Just for kicks and giggles, we can peek underneath the wireless charging coil and get a glimpse
dataset/train/83_94.wav|straight into the center of the phone. The motherboard and battery, which we successfully
dataset/train/83_95.wav|stabbed earlier in the video, are both clearly visible. There is no metal backplate behind
dataset/train/83_96.wav|the wireless charging coil, which also goes against this image of the Pixel 5 that's been
dataset/train/83_97.wav|floating around. This image is not an actual representation of how the phone is built since
dataset/train/83_98.wav|it's missing the gigantic hole in the center. A few clarifying words on Google's website
dataset/train/83_99.wav|about the phone's composition would go a long way. It's not even continuous metal underneath
dataset/train/83_100.wav|all the plastic.
dataset/train/83_101.wav|With the phone not working anymore after that battery puncture, we really can't do the screen
dataset/train/83_102.wav|burn test, which I'm sure will cause much disappointment to all. But we still have one
dataset/train/83_103.wav|question we can answer. Since this phone has such a large cutout in the center for that
dataset/train/83_104.wav|wireless charging, does the hole make the phone weaker structurally? Even though we're
dataset/train/83_105.wav|missing large chunks of the phone's plastic exterior, the Pixel 5 holds up very well.
dataset/train/83_106.wav|Flipping it over to bend from the back shows that the screen does start to pop out from
dataset/train/83_107.wav|the frame, ruining that seal for the water-resistance. But there is no catastrophic damage to the
dataset/train/83_108.wav|screen or the frame. Well, I mean, no additional catastrophic damage.
dataset/train/83_109.wav|To summarize, is the Pixel 5 really made of metal? The answer is yes, but also no. Google
dataset/train/83_110.wav|seems to have done a good job with just about everything except for explaining accurately
dataset/train/83_111.wav|what the Pixel 5 is made of, which is kind of the whole phone. Let me know what you think
dataset/train/83_112.wav|down in the comments. Should this Pixel 5 be branded as plastic or metal? I'm curious.
dataset/train/83_113.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Grab your free audiobook from Audible with
dataset/train/83_114.wav|the link in the description. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/84_1.wav|Today it's time to take apart the new iPhone 12 Pro Max – Apple's latest and greatest,
dataset/train/84_2.wav|most powerful iPhone. And also the largest iPhone that's ever been made,
dataset/train/84_3.wav|with supposedly a new trick inside that we've never seen before. I kind of broke
dataset/train/84_4.wav|the last iPhone I took apart, so cross your fingers this one survives. Let's get started.
dataset/train/84_5.wav|So the iPhone 12 Pro Max is basically just a larger version of the iPhone 12 Pro.
dataset/train/84_6.wav|With Apple releasing four new iPhones this year, it does get a little confusing.
dataset/train/84_7.wav|All you really need to know though is that the Pro Max has a larger screen,
dataset/train/84_8.wav|larger battery, and some slightly better cameras. Which is what we are after today. If you remember,
dataset/train/84_9.wav|last time I was trying to remove the screen, I accidentally pried up underneath the glass,
dataset/train/84_10.wav|instead of underneath the plastic frame, and broke the display. This time I'm making sure
dataset/train/84_11.wav|to lift the screen up high enough that I can get underneath the plastic part of the
dataset/train/84_12.wav|display with my pry tools. Since the screen is recessed, this is much harder than it looks.
dataset/train/84_13.wav|The reason we want to check out the camera units inside of the Max is because Apple has engineered
dataset/train/84_14.wav|a new form of image stabilization that we've never seen inside of a smartphone before. It's called
dataset/train/84_15.wav|Sensor Shift, and can stabilize an image at over 5,000 times a second. So if this is true,
dataset/train/84_16.wav|it's actually pretty huge, and a pretty big step forward in the mobile camera game.
dataset/train/84_17.wav|As we can see, my screen is still working so far. Thumbs up for that. We're off to a good start.
dataset/train/84_18.wav|There are 4 screws holding down a metal plate over the battery connector and screen ribbon.
dataset/train/84_19.wav|Once that's off, I can unplug the battery like a little Lego and then move to the second metal
dataset/train/84_20.wav|plate that covers the other ribbon connector. It also has 4 screws. Once that's removed I can
dataset/train/84_21.wav|unplug the remaining screen ribbon and detach the display from the body. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/84_22.wav|The cameras are all under this other metal plate, but first let's take out the battery.
dataset/train/84_23.wav|Usually Apple's pull tabs are kind of fun.
dataset/train/84_24.wav|But not so much this time around. All of the magical pull tabs keep on breaking.
dataset/train/84_25.wav|But with a dab of isopropyl alcohol, the stickiness underneath the battery dissolves
dataset/train/84_26.wav|and I can pry the battery out relatively easily. The alcohol is non-conductive and evaporates
dataset/train/84_27.wav|pretty quickly so it doesn't hurt the electronics. But still, battery replacements could be easier.
dataset/train/84_28.wav|Now we can see what the pull tabs are supposed to be doing if we could actually grip them.
dataset/train/84_29.wav|As they stretch, theoretically, they lose their stickiness
dataset/train/84_30.wav|and just pull right out from underneath the battery...just not this time around.
dataset/train/84_31.wav|Now it's time to check out Apple's latest innovation in mobile camera technology.
dataset/train/84_32.wav|I know we don't always use “Apple” and “innovative” in the same sentence,
dataset/train/84_33.wav|but here we are, and it's actually pretty impressive.
dataset/train/84_34.wav|So inside the 12 Pro Max, the top camera is the telephoto, which does have optical image
dataset/train/84_35.wav|stabilization where the lens does the moving. He wide angle is off to the side with no OIS. And the
dataset/train/84_36.wav|main sensor is at the bottom. And it looks like it does not have OIS, since the exterior lens is
dataset/train/84_37.wav|not moving. But that's actually not the case. The main camera has that sensor shift that we
dataset/train/84_38.wav|talked about earlier which is actually much better and much cooler than regular OIS. But
dataset/train/84_39.wav|first let's grab the main camera lens out of the regular iPhone 12 Pro so that we can compare them.
dataset/train/84_40.wav|The regular size 12 Pro has it's main sensor at the top instead of the bottom.
dataset/train/84_41.wav|The telephoto and main sensor locations are reversed between the two phones.
dataset/train/84_42.wav|But that's not super important. All of the cameras are very securely glued into a metal
dataset/train/84_43.wav|housing so they can work seamlessly with one another when the phone switches camera
dataset/train/84_44.wav|perspectives. Popping the camera module out from the housing is difficult but still possible.
dataset/train/84_45.wav|Remember, we're still working with the normal iPhone 12 Pro at this point, not the Max just yet.
dataset/train/84_46.wav|Once the main camera is out, I can start opening up the camera module. This kills the module,
dataset/train/84_47.wav|but if phone carnage made you queasy, you probably wouldn't be subscribed like you are right now.
dataset/train/84_48.wav|I can break open and peel away the metal housing surrounding the camera lens and the camera sensor.
dataset/train/84_49.wav|You can see that the camera lens floats over the top of the sensor
dataset/train/84_50.wav|like a hoverboard from Back to the Future. The top lens is wiggling to compensate for
dataset/train/84_51.wav|and stabilize the shakes that happen to the phone while you're taking a picture
dataset/train/84_52.wav|or a video. This type of OIS can stabilize at about 1,000x a second, which is impressive,
dataset/train/84_53.wav|but not quite as impressive as what's inside of the Max. Taking a look at both camera housings,
dataset/train/84_54.wav|we can see that the iPhone 12 Pro Max is indeed quite a bit larger than the iPhone 12 Pro.
dataset/train/84_55.wav|Optical image stabilization has been a big deal for flagship smartphones for the past few years.
dataset/train/84_56.wav|However, professional real size cameras like this GH5 sometimes have a type of
dataset/train/84_57.wav|stabilization that is called Sensor Shift. It's an internal stabilization method that
dataset/train/84_58.wav|moves the sensor itself to stabilize the image instead of moving the exterior lens.
dataset/train/84_59.wav|It's much faster since it happens right at the picture collection point – the sensor.
dataset/train/84_60.wav|This technology has only been found in DSLRs until now.
dataset/train/84_61.wav|Apple says they've included this Sensor Shift technology on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
dataset/train/84_62.wav|It's on the largest sensor of the grouping, and it's just as difficult to get inside of as the
dataset/train/84_63.wav|regular iPhone 12 Pro. But pretty much anything is possible with the razor blade. I'm actually pretty
dataset/train/84_64.wav|excited to get inside of this one. Seeing brand new technology from the inside is why we're here.
dataset/train/84_65.wav|Once the back metal is off, we get our first look at the bottom side of the camera sensor.
dataset/train/84_66.wav|And it is indeed shifting, moving around inside of the housing while the exterior lens stays in
dataset/train/84_67.wav|the same spot. It looks like Apple has indeed done it. They've done something new. I'll pop
dataset/train/84_68.wav|the camera lens off so we can see how it works. Apple says that instead of the normal 1,000
dataset/train/84_69.wav|adjustments per second that we see with regular OIS, this new Sensor Shift method can stabilize up
dataset/train/84_70.wav|to 5,000 times per second, which is a pretty big deal, and means we get quite a bit more accuracy.
dataset/train/84_71.wav|The camera lens portion of the housing has several large magnets. And when I say large,
dataset/train/84_72.wav|I mean the size of an ant, but still proportional to the camera it's pretty big. These magnets sit
dataset/train/84_73.wav|on top of tiny coils that can ever so slightly shift the position of that sensor. The sensor
dataset/train/84_74.wav|shifts around inside of its housing just like we saw on the professional camera. And at 5,000
dataset/train/84_75.wav|times a second, it happens pretty fast. Of course the sensor of the Max is a tiny bit
dataset/train/84_76.wav|larger than the iPhone 12 Pro, which we can see now that they are side by side. This means that
dataset/train/84_77.wav|the larger sensor on the Max can absorb a tiny bit more light which is a good thing. The pixel
dataset/train/84_78.wav|size themselves are also a 0.3 micrometers larger on the Max than they are on the regular. I'll let
dataset/train/84_79.wav|other reviewers be the judge of the actual camera image quality. But if you want the best of the
dataset/train/84_80.wav|subtle camera improvements, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is where Apple has put everything they've got.
dataset/train/84_81.wav|I'll get the phone reassembled to make sure I don't break it this time around...well,
dataset/train/84_82.wav|break the important parts. You know what I mean. The phone should still work without the
dataset/train/84_83.wav|rear camera modules installed. Once the battery is plugged in and the metal plates are back in place,
dataset/train/84_84.wav|the phone does indeed turn back on, which is a good thing.
dataset/train/84_85.wav|Breaking two iPhones in a row would have been kind of embarrassing. With the cameras missing, the
dataset/train/84_86.wav|camera app does still open up, but just doesn't find anything to show us. Kind of interesting.
dataset/train/84_87.wav|If you think it's fun to see the insides of high-tech technology,
dataset/train/84_88.wav|but also enjoy things like water resistance, warranties, and your phone still working,
dataset/train/84_89.wav|you might like my Teardown Skin. It's an exact representation of what's inside of your smartphone
dataset/train/84_90.wav|while keeping all the important bits covered. I'll have to update the Sensor Shift portion around the
dataset/train/84_91.wav|camera lens because it looks pretty cool. But yeah. I'll put a link for the Teardown Skin
dataset/train/84_92.wav|down in the video description. We're covering more than 60 devices now, so we probably have one for
dataset/train/84_93.wav|whatever phone you're using. If you're curious about the large wireless charging coil, or the
dataset/train/84_94.wav|ring of magnets, you can check out my full iPhone 12 Pro teardown video where I explain all of that.
dataset/train/84_95.wav|I'll leave a link for that in the description as well. I think Apple's done a good job this year.
dataset/train/84_96.wav|Let me know what you think of the Sensor Shift technology down in the comments. And
dataset/train/84_97.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/85_1.wav|Today we're going to be durability testing two phones at the same time: the iPhone 12
dataset/train/85_2.wav|Pro Max and the iPhone 12 mini. Honestly, there isn't a whole lot of difference between
dataset/train/85_3.wav|the phones except for the size. But the size isn't enough that we should check the structural
dataset/train/85_4.wav|integrity. After all, the Max is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made. Quick little cash
dataset/train/85_5.wav|fact with Jerry though. This $10 bill might look normal from the outside. It's got Alexander
dataset/train/85_6.wav|Hamilton on the front. You know, the guy from the musical. But when you shine a light behind
dataset/train/85_7.wav|the bill, the ghost of Alexander Hamilton appears, which is kind of spooky since he
dataset/train/85_8.wav|was killed in a pistol duel. Huge thanks to Ridge Wallets for sponsoring this video. I've
dataset/train/85_9.wav|had my Ridge Wallet for about 2 years now. It's a front pocket wallet. And while they
dataset/train/85_10.wav|have over 30 different colors and styles, my favorite is the Burnt Titanium. But this
dataset/train/85_11.wav|Carbon Fiber's pretty cool as well. The carbon fiber fibers are woven into a 3K pattern,
dataset/train/85_12.wav|overlaid with epoxy resin, and finished off with a matte scratch resistant coating. You
dataset/train/85_13.wav|can test out one of these Ridge Wallets for 45 days, and if you don't like it you can
dataset/train/85_14.wav|send it back for a full refund. The Forage Carbon Wallet is made from compressing carbon
dataset/train/85_15.wav|fibers and resin, which makes a different unique pattern for every wallet. It's also
dataset/train/85_16.wav|got that same scratch resistant matte coating on the top. And they all hold 12 cards, plus
dataset/train/85_17.wav|cash. If you use the code “jerryrig” you can get 10% off your order and free worldwide
dataset/train/85_18.wav|shipping. I've definitely been happy with mine. I'll leave a link down in the video
dataset/train/85_19.wav|description.
dataset/train/85_20.wav|Now it's time to durability test the new iPhones. Let's get started.
dataset/train/85_21.wav|The iPhone 12 Pro that we've already tested is the medium sized version which sits between
dataset/train/85_22.wav|each of these new iPhones. The typical design is the same. The only thing that really changes
dataset/train/85_23.wav|is the size. And the fact that the Mini is made from aluminum instead of stainless steel.
dataset/train/85_24.wav|But we'll get to that in a minute. As you can see there is no charger in either of the
dataset/train/85_25.wav|boxes, but Apple is always removing something so no surprises there. The size difference
dataset/train/85_26.wav|though is surprising. The Max is pretty much the same size as my Note 10 Plus. And the
dataset/train/85_27.wav|Mini is about the size of the old iPhone SE.
dataset/train/85_28.wav|The phones are mirror images of each other. Four icons to a row on either device. Personally,
dataset/train/85_29.wav|I think with more screen real estate on the Max it would be nice if the larger iPhone
dataset/train/85_30.wav|could fit more stuff, or even do a split screen like the Androids can. Maybe they'll catch
dataset/train/85_31.wav|up in a couple years. Another difference between the phones is the camera units. The iPhone
dataset/train/85_32.wav|Mini only has 2 cameras, while the Max has 3. I'll get to that more in a second. The
dataset/train/85_33.wav|Mini starts at $729, while the Max is $1,099. As far as the screen material goes, Apple
dataset/train/85_34.wav|is using their new ceramic shield on the display. Ceramic shield is their special form of glass
dataset/train/85_35.wav|that has ceramic crystals embedded into the matrix. Yeah, we've already tested this once,
dataset/train/85_36.wav|but what's better than one test? Three.
dataset/train/85_37.wav|Ceramics usually scratch at around 8 or 9 on Mohs scale of hardness. It's right up there
dataset/train/85_38.wav|with sapphire. And I'm no materials expert, but Apple says by embedding ceramic crystals
dataset/train/85_39.wav|into the glass matrix it's improved the shatter resistance. But they don't mention much about
dataset/train/85_40.wav|the scratch resistance. After working my way up through Mohs scale of hardness, we can
dataset/train/85_41.wav|take a look at the screen. And we do see scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level
dataset/train/85_42.wav|7. But with that being said, it does look like the level 6 scratches are much more prominent
dataset/train/85_43.wav|than usual. We see the same thing on the Max, which also has ceramic shield The level 6
dataset/train/85_44.wav|scratches are there, just not as visible. It's hard to accurately show with just one
dataset/train/85_45.wav|phone since it is still glass. The difference becomes much more dramatic when we see a ceramic
dataset/train/85_46.wav|shield placed next to the regular glass from last year. If we look at the previous iPhone
dataset/train/85_47.wav|11, the difference in damage is much more visible. So while both screens can scratch
dataset/train/85_48.wav|at level 6, I do think Corning's onto something with this new ceramic shield stuff. It does
dataset/train/85_49.wav|seem slightly more scratch resistant, and it's even more impressive if those 4x more
dataset/train/85_50.wav|shatter resistance claims are true. But no matter how durable a smartphone claims to
dataset/train/85_51.wav|be, it's always just better to accidentally scratch or damage a $10 screen protector,
dataset/train/85_52.wav|instead of the $1,000 phone. Accidents happen.
dataset/train/85_53.wav|Since the screen on these new phones is totally flat, dbrand's screen protector sits just
dataset/train/85_54.wav|over the frame. The red Mini has the screen protector installed, while the Max does not.
dataset/train/85_55.wav|So if the phone does ever come in contact with something sketchy, like a razor blade
dataset/train/85_56.wav|rubbing all up on the surface...or, you know, a power drill. Sorry Siri. With the screen
dataset/train/85_57.wav|protector there is nothing to stress about since not only is the screen protector undamaged,
dataset/train/85_58.wav|the phone is even more undamaged with its protective layer. I'll leave a link for the
dataset/train/85_59.wav|screen protector down in the video description. After 2020, we all deserve a little less stress.
dataset/train/85_60.wav|Speaking of damage though, it's time to check the difference between aluminum and stainless
dataset/train/85_61.wav|steel. The iPhone 12 Mini has an aluminum frame. Aluminum is a softer metal. And as
dataset/train/85_62.wav|we can see, it covers every single side of the phone. Stainless steel is quite a bit
dataset/train/85_63.wav|harder. My razor struggles getting a good bite Since the blade is made from stainless
dataset/train/85_64.wav|steel as well. The painted surface can still scratch so it's not invincible. Stainless
dataset/train/85_65.wav|is also heavier than aluminum, but I'm a fan of that. Heavy phones just have a nicer feel
dataset/train/85_66.wav|to them. The back glass is also different. The Mini has a smooth glossy feel, while the
dataset/train/85_67.wav|Max is textured or frosted. The cameras as well are different. The Mini mimics the iPhone
dataset/train/85_68.wav|12's two cameras with its 12 megapixel normal and 12 megapixel ultra wide lens. While the
dataset/train/85_69.wav|larger iPhone, the Max, mimics the iPhone 12 Pro's 3 cameras, it does have slightly
dataset/train/85_70.wav|larger sensor sizes which we'll have to see from the inside during the teardown. It's
dataset/train/85_71.wav|got the 12 megapixel normal lens, the wide angle lens, and a 2.5x telephoto lens, which
dataset/train/85_72.wav|is half a point improvement over the iPhone 12 Pro's 2x zoom. The Max has a lidar camera
dataset/train/85_73.wav|as well. It is odd that Apple would only increase the telephoto by .5, while other phones exist
dataset/train/85_74.wav|with 5 and 10x optical zoom. But they do like playing it safe.
dataset/train/85_75.wav|The iPhone Mini has a 5.4 inch display, while the Max has a 6.7 inch. Both are the super
dataset/train/85_76.wav|retina OLED. It's kind of like the proverbial David and Goliath...except for neither of
dataset/train/85_77.wav|these phones are the good guy since they are both just trying to take your money. I left
dataset/train/85_78.wav|my lighters in place for about 50 seconds which is a pretty long time. Neither of the
dataset/train/85_79.wav|phones sustained any permanent damage, minus the oleophobic layer evaporating of course.
dataset/train/85_80.wav|The OLED pixels are unaffected. It makes me wonder if those ceramic crystals are doing
dataset/train/85_81.wav|a better job of insulating from the heat.
dataset/train/85_82.wav|Now for the bend test. Can the aluminum frame of the iPhone 12 Mini hold up under pressure?
dataset/train/85_83.wav|When bending from the back there is a very subtle give to the frame, but no curve, cracks
dataset/train/85_84.wav|or kinks to speak of. Nor when bent from the front. The iPhone 12 Mini is a solid little
dataset/train/85_85.wav|tank of a smartphone, right alongside it's regular sized iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12
dataset/train/85_86.wav|Pro Max though, with it's increased physical size and footprint is also a non-flexing structural
dataset/train/85_87.wav|behemoth. The stainless steel with it's inlaid glass panels on front and back are incredibly
dataset/train/85_88.wav|stiff, even with its ginormous size. Apple has once again made some structurally solid
dataset/train/85_89.wav|phones. They are, of course, still glass on both sides and still need to be protected.
dataset/train/85_90.wav|But other than that, structurally, this new generation of iPhones feels and looks pretty
dataset/train/85_91.wav|great.
dataset/train/85_92.wav|The display of the Mini is freaking out a bit. Not being as responsive as it should
dataset/train/85_93.wav|be. Probably from the fire. But a quick turning off of the screen and turning it back on again
dataset/train/85_94.wav|corrects the touch sensitivity and brings it back to normal. Which of these phones do
dataset/train/85_95.wav|you want to see taken apart? I'm leaning towards the Max so we can see how much bigger those
dataset/train/85_96.wav|sensors are inside of the camera. And I have to redeem myself for breaking the iPhone 12
dataset/train/85_97.wav|Pro screen in front of everyone. So let me know which one you want to see opened up down
dataset/train/85_98.wav|in the comments.
dataset/train/85_99.wav|Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you
dataset/train/85_100.wav|around.
dataset/train/86_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart Google's cheapest phone:
dataset/train/86_2.wav|the plastic Pixel 4a. Last year, the Pixel 3a won my Most Repairable Smartphone of 2019.
dataset/train/86_3.wav|So the 4a has pretty big shoes to fill. Let's get started.
dataset/train/86_4.wav|The Pixel 4a has a few different layers: the screen, the mid frame, and then the back panel.
dataset/train/86_5.wav|This phone is not built like a conventional phone. One of the things that makes the 4a so repairable
dataset/train/86_6.wav|is that the screen comes off first and there's nothing attached to it. Screen repairs are some
dataset/train/86_7.wav|of the most common repairs, so it's nice when it can be done in just a few minutes. The problem
dataset/train/86_8.wav|though is that the screen itself, underneath the glass is just about as thin as a potato chip
dataset/train/86_9.wav|and just as fragile. So the chance of the screen surviving a teardown is slimmer than usual.
dataset/train/86_10.wav|And judging by the crack in the display underneath the glass, I think this one's
dataset/train/86_11.wav|a goner. Potato chips aren't very strong. We'll have to see if I broke it for good or not later.
dataset/train/86_12.wav|The 4a seems to be constructed in pretty much the exact same way as the Pixel 3a from last year
dataset/train/86_13.wav|with just one ribbon cable and it's two T3 screws holding the ribbon in place.
dataset/train/86_14.wav|Last year's Pixel 3a screen replacement costs about $80
dataset/train/86_15.wav|this year. So not too bad. The rest of the screws in this phone are a slightly larger T4 size.
dataset/train/86_16.wav|I'll include the tool kit that I'm using down in the video description.
dataset/train/86_17.wav|There are 8 screws holding down that mid frame And then we can pop the mid-frame out and away from
dataset/train/86_18.wav|the back plastics...well almost. Apparently someone left the SIM card tray installed,
dataset/train/86_19.wav|but I don't want to point any fingers. It's time to call for unity.
dataset/train/86_20.wav|The motherboard is attached to the underside of the mid frame Two thin ribbon cables connect
dataset/train/86_21.wav|the board to the back plastic housing and before we can unclip those ribbons,
dataset/train/86_22.wav|I need to remove 7 more T4 screws holding down the metal shield over the motherboard.
dataset/train/86_23.wav|Once that's gone then we can unclip the fingerprint scanner and the rear flash...
dataset/train/86_24.wav|just like little Legos. Which then releases the plastic housing
dataset/train/86_25.wav|and it's delicious candy corn from the phone.
dataset/train/86_26.wav|Something that's probably equally delicious is this mountain of pink thermal foam near the
dataset/train/86_27.wav|camera lens. Probably the thickest we've ever seen. It's a little squishy forbidden snack
dataset/train/86_28.wav|acting like a piece of cake or something.
dataset/train/86_29.wav|Moving onto the battery. This is where I got tricked. Without any visible pull
dataset/train/86_30.wav|tabs I thought for sure Google was going to get a talking to about repairability.
dataset/train/86_31.wav|But after prying up the battery, I do see pull tabs. But for some reason the tabs are too deep
dataset/train/86_32.wav|underneath the battery to ever be reachable. I thought that maybe Google might have gotten the
dataset/train/86_33.wav|wrong size pull tabs on clearance from the battery pull tab store, you know, to keep the price low.
dataset/train/86_34.wav|But it turns out, battery pull tabs are meant to be pulled from the opposite side of the mid frame
dataset/train/86_35.wav|So the 4a does have magical pull tabs and they are indeed functional...just
dataset/train/86_36.wav|not in the place that they normally are. No complaints here though.
dataset/train/86_37.wav|With an easy screen and battery replacement, the Pixel 4a is still really repairable.
dataset/train/86_38.wav|The Pixel 4a battery is 3140 milliamp hours, which is quite a bit larger than the iPhone 12
dataset/train/86_39.wav|Pro. Awkward. I'll pull the loudspeaker out. This guy does have a white sticker on top that holds in
dataset/train/86_40.wav|a bunch of the sound dampening balls. These little circles of foam help it sound bigger
dataset/train/86_41.wav|than it actually is. And if we take a look at the speaker opening on the frame, we can see
dataset/train/86_42.wav|that there is indeed some waterproofing mesh. But don't get too excited about water resistance just
dataset/train/86_43.wav|yet since there still is none anywhere else. The motherboard itself has two screws holding
dataset/train/86_44.wav|it in place, and a series of black clips around the outside that keep it snug into the mid frame
dataset/train/86_45.wav|Once it's out we can get our first look at the singular camera which does have OIS.
dataset/train/86_46.wav|Not too shabby. And over here on the motherboard we find the white water damage indicator sticker
dataset/train/86_47.wav|that's underneath the headphone jack. I assume Google stuck it here in this specific position
dataset/train/86_48.wav|because that's where they assume water is most likely to enter the phone. The sticker will
dataset/train/86_49.wav|turn pink if it ever gets wet. So it's still important to keep your phone away from water.
dataset/train/86_50.wav|The front facing camera is 8 megapixels and does not have the optical image
dataset/train/86_51.wav|stabilization. The side buttons do have their own ribbon with gold contact pads that communicate
dataset/train/86_52.wav|with the motherboard when it's resting against the frame. And the headphone jack is not water tight
dataset/train/86_53.wav|as we can see from how easy it is to remove from the phone.
dataset/train/86_54.wav|Down here at the bottom we have the smallest of charging port ribbons, along with the circular
dataset/train/86_55.wav|vibrator. And as far as cooling goes, there is a small layer of copper foil facilitating the heat
dataset/train/86_56.wav|transfer between the motherboard and the metal mid frame. This mid frame is probably what kept the
dataset/train/86_57.wav|phone from snapping during my durability test. The outsides might be plastic, but the insides most
dataset/train/86_58.wav|definitely are not. I'll get the motherboard back in along with the loudspeaker, which is
dataset/train/86_59.wav|still leaking balls all over the place. Once that sticker comes off it doesn't go back on very well.
dataset/train/86_60.wav|Personally, I'm glad that Google made the 4a. It's cheap, repairable, and has the good camera that
dataset/train/86_61.wav|Google is known for. And not everyone wants to buy a smartphone that costs as much as a used car.
dataset/train/86_62.wav|Once I get the mid frame screwed back into the plastic back,
dataset/train/86_63.wav|we can position the screen over its Lego-style connector, get it clipped in,
dataset/train/86_64.wav|and....well, I guess 2020 isn't over yet. I have made a Teardown Skin for the Pixel 4a,
dataset/train/86_65.wav|so you can get all the perks of getting inside of your phone without actually getting inside of
dataset/train/86_66.wav|your phone. The Skin also works with a dbrand Grip so you can have style and protection,
dataset/train/86_67.wav|with the clicky buttons as a cherry on top. I'll leave a link in the video description.
dataset/train/86_68.wav|We have Teardown Skins for over 60 devices now so there's a good chance we're covering yours.
dataset/train/86_69.wav|Let me know what phones you want to see tested before the end of the year down in the comments.
dataset/train/86_70.wav|And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching,
dataset/train/86_71.wav|I'll see you around.
dataset/train/87_1.wav|The Google Pixel 4a is one of the cheapest smartphones I've reviewed all year.
dataset/train/87_2.wav|It's just $350. Feels good to finally have a phone in front of us that won't break the bank. But if
dataset/train/87_3.wav|it's not breaking the bank, will it just break in general? There's really only one way to find out.
dataset/train/87_4.wav|This video is sponsored by Audible. Let's get started.
dataset/train/87_5.wav|First thing, let's see what's inside the box. It could be nothing or it could be everything.
dataset/train/87_6.wav|It's hard to say for sure these days. Looks like we have a USB-C power cord and a charging brick
dataset/train/87_7.wav|that can charge at 18 watts. Surprising there are no headphones though, since the Pixel 4a is also
dataset/train/87_8.wav|one of the first phones in a while to bring back the headphone jack. No complaints here.
dataset/train/87_9.wav|Let's start with the scratch test. The Pixel 4a is using some old school Gorilla Glass 3,
dataset/train/87_10.wav|so we already know where it's going to scratch, but we might as well check anyway. Remember,
dataset/train/87_11.wav|glass is glass whether it's Gorilla Glass 3, 5, or victus, the scratching level will be the same. But
dataset/train/87_12.wav|the toughness, as in the shadow resistance, might improve slightly with each new level of glass.
dataset/train/87_13.wav|Toughness is hard to quantify because changing the shape of the glass or the curve of the screen
dataset/train/87_14.wav|also affects the strength. The Pixel 4a scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/87_15.wav|Keys, coins, and razor blades won't have any affect on the glass,
dataset/train/87_16.wav|or the 8 megapixel front facing hole punch camera up here in the top corner.
dataset/train/87_17.wav|The top stereo speaker grill and earpiece is made from plastic and secure. It's only when
dataset/train/87_18.wav|we turn the phone to the side that we see how Google got this phone so cheap – it's
dataset/train/87_19.wav|plastic. My razor can easily carve huge chunks of plastic away from the sides of the phone.
dataset/train/87_20.wav|Now, of course, there is nothing wrong with plastic. Honestly, I kind of like it
dataset/train/87_21.wav|since the Pixel 4a will literally never have a shattered glass back to replace,
dataset/train/87_22.wav|unlike the $400 iPhone SE whose broken glass back costs $270 to fix.
dataset/train/87_23.wav|Once we get down here to the bottom USB-C charging port and stereo speaker, we do see something
dataset/train/87_24.wav|interesting. There are no antenna lines on the Pixel 4a which gives it a nice smooth uniform
dataset/train/87_25.wav|design all the way around. Google was able to accomplish this no antenna design by putting
dataset/train/87_26.wav|those antennas as a thing metallic layer embedded inside the plastic around the bottom and top of
dataset/train/87_27.wav|the phone. The metallic layer doesn't encompass the whole phone, it's just at the ends. You can
dataset/train/87_28.wav|see the top of the phone has more thin copper right next to our friend, the headphone jack.
dataset/train/87_29.wav|There's plenty more plastic here next to the removable SIM card tray. There's no water
dataset/train/87_30.wav|resistance rating on the Pixel 4a. The Google G on the back is lightly painted onto the surface,
dataset/train/87_31.wav|so it might rub off eventually, but not a big deal. Overall it's a very
dataset/train/87_32.wav|simple and inexpensive design. Quite the opposite of the very
dataset/train/87_33.wav|complex and expensive RGB gaming phones that cost quite a bit more.
dataset/train/87_34.wav|Speaking of gaming, do you remember Ready Player One – both the movie and the story?
dataset/train/87_35.wav|One thing I'm looking forward to from Audible, who's sponsoring this video, is Ready Player Two
dataset/train/87_36.wav|that comes out on November 24, here in 2020. I've already preordered the audiobook with one
dataset/train/87_37.wav|of my credits since Ready Player One was one of my all-time favorites. You can get your own free
dataset/train/87_38.wav|audio book with a 30 day trial of Audible. Audible.com/jerryrig. Or text “jerryrig” to
dataset/train/87_39.wav|500-500. If you haven't already listened to Ready Player One, you should probably start there,
dataset/train/87_40.wav|you won't regret it. The story is quite a bit different than what we saw on the movie,
dataset/train/87_41.wav|and equally entertaining. Audible.com/jerryrig or
dataset/train/87_42.wav|text “jerryrig” to 500-500. I'll leave a link down in the description.
dataset/train/87_43.wav|The downside of the Pixel 4a is it's one camera perspective.
dataset/train/87_44.wav|You would think there would be more cameras hidden under this massive square glass camera housing,
dataset/train/87_45.wav|but there isn't. From everything I've seen though, that one 12 megapixel camera is pretty great.
dataset/train/87_46.wav|But sometimes it's nice having a wide angle or telephoto camera for a unique perspective.
dataset/train/87_47.wav|After all the craziness that's gone on in 2020,
dataset/train/87_48.wav|I decided it might be best if Art Class with Jerry was something non-controversial.
dataset/train/87_49.wav|You know, I could just draw something we could all universally agree on,
dataset/train/87_50.wav|like how candy corn is the best tasting candy of the holidays.
dataset/train/87_51.wav|You can let me know how much you like candy corn down in the comments.
dataset/train/87_52.wav|There is no metallic layer on the back of the Pixel 4a, it is all pure plastic.
dataset/train/87_53.wav|The last few phones that I've tested have all had underscreen fingerprint scanners,
dataset/train/87_54.wav|and have all been equally underwhelming...some not even able to read my fingerprint because
dataset/train/87_55.wav|my hands aren't squeaky clean. But that's not the case with this Pixel 4a. The rear
dataset/train/87_56.wav|fingerprint scanner was able to set up my fingerprint super fast
dataset/train/87_57.wav|and recognize it every single time, even with substantial damage made
dataset/train/87_58.wav|to the fingerprint scanner surface. Not bad at all. Thumbs up for that.
dataset/train/87_59.wav|The Pixel 4a has a 5.8 inch 1080p OLED display, which we can confirm by seeing the pixels turning
dataset/train/87_60.wav|slightly white after 20 seconds from the heat of my lighter. The screen did still mostly recover.
dataset/train/87_61.wav|But $350 is $350. And if a phone sacrifices too much durability to achieve a low price point, then
dataset/train/87_62.wav|it's just not worth buying. With the first bend of the Pixel 4a we see that curve, but the phone
dataset/train/87_63.wav|locks out and does not snap in half or crack. And it's the same for both sides. The Pixel 4a might
dataset/train/87_64.wav|be the most durable budget phone of 2020. The Nord snapped, and the iPhone SE has a glass back.
dataset/train/87_65.wav|Overall I'm impressed with the Pixel 4a. I don't talk about software much on my channel,
dataset/train/87_66.wav|but it also has a robocall blocking feature that I'd love to try out. Those are pretty much the
dataset/train/87_67.wav|worst. Let me know if there's any other budget phones you want me to sneak in before the end of
dataset/train/87_68.wav|the year. And we'll be taking a look at the inside of the Pixel 4a. So hit that subscribe button if
dataset/train/87_69.wav|you haven't already. Grab your free audio book from Audible with the link in the description. And
dataset/train/87_70.wav|come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/88_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart the brand new iPhone 12 Pro. We already know the outside
dataset/train/88_2.wav|is new and different, with its stainless steel sides, flush screen, and ceramic shield glass,
dataset/train/88_3.wav|but we know true beauty lies on the inside. The iPhone 12 Pro has a series of magnets
dataset/train/88_4.wav|just below the back glass, and I'm curious to see what those look like from the inside.
dataset/train/88_5.wav|One thing you'll really want to avoid though is letting your wallet or credit card get
dataset/train/88_6.wav|too close to the back of the phone. Magnet can ruin credit cards...unless of course you
dataset/train/88_7.wav|carry a shielded wallet. Huge thanks to Ridge Wallets for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/88_8.wav|I got my own Ridge Wallet about 2 years ago and it's been in my front pocket ever since.
dataset/train/88_9.wav|I got the Burnt Titanium version since titanium is one of the coolest metals in existence.
dataset/train/88_10.wav|Fun fact: did you know there's a hidden spider on the one dollar bill? Cool little trick
dataset/train/88_11.wav|to show your friends. All you need is a dollar and some friends. If you don't have either,
dataset/train/88_12.wav|you can still optimistically get a new wallet and just hope for the best...like we're all
dataset/train/88_13.wav|doing for 2021. Mine's a bit worn after being in my pocket for two years, but the Burnt
dataset/train/88_14.wav|Titanium still looks pretty good. It can hold up to 12 cards plus cash. The Ridge Wallet
dataset/train/88_15.wav|comes in 30 different styles, like aluminum, carbon fiber, orange carbon, and a limited
dataset/train/88_16.wav|edition topographical map of Half Dome. And you can choose between the money strap or
dataset/train/88_17.wav|the clip version. Since these are metal of course, you probably don't want to carry them
dataset/train/88_18.wav|in the same pocket as your iPhone, but it's good to know that if they do ever end up next
dataset/train/88_19.wav|to each other on a table or desk or something, the magnets in your phone won't hurt the card
dataset/train/88_20.wav|since the wallet will shield it. I'll leave a link down in the description. You can use
dataset/train/88_21.wav|the code “jerryrig” to get 10% off your order and free worldwide shipping. There's
dataset/train/88_22.wav|a lifetime warranty and a full 45 day return policy if you don't like it. I've definitely
dataset/train/88_23.wav|been happy with mine though.
dataset/train/88_24.wav|Now it's time to take apart the new iPhone 12 Pro. Let's get started.
dataset/train/88_25.wav|The iPhone 12 Pro design has changed things up a bit this year, but of course it still
dataset/train/88_26.wav|has the two pentalobe screws down at the bottom. This time around the iPhone 12 Pro has quite
dataset/train/88_27.wav|a bit more water resistance as well. Still ip68, but tested at a depth of 6 meters in
dataset/train/88_28.wav|water instead of the normal 4 meters, that the iPhone 11 Pro was tested at last year.
dataset/train/88_29.wav|So there is quite a bit more adhesive which requires more heat. And the screen being inlaid
dataset/train/88_30.wav|flush with the stainless steel housing also makes things a little more difficult. Long
dataset/train/88_31.wav|story short, the quickest way to learn something new is by using someone else's mistakes...and
dataset/train/88_32.wav|as I was lifting up the screen I didn't go quite deep enough to grab the frame and I
dataset/train/88_33.wav|accidentally stabbed the screen under the glass. And while I was able to get the screen
dataset/train/88_34.wav|off in one piece, that little stab in the wrong spot killed the screen entirely. So
dataset/train/88_35.wav|it's a good idea to learn from my mistakes if you ever attempt to open one of these up.
dataset/train/88_36.wav|The phone is still alive, but now I'll need a new screen.
dataset/train/88_37.wav|Anyway, besides the fact that I just broke a phone in front of millions of people...there
dataset/train/88_38.wav|are 2 tri point screws holding down a metal plate over the battery. I'll remove those
dataset/train/88_39.wav|as well as the metal plate so we can get to the real goods inside. I'll unsnap the battery
dataset/train/88_40.wav|ribbon just like a little Lego, along with the screen ribbon. There's another plate up
dataset/train/88_41.wav|top with 4 more tri point screws that I'll remove before unsnapping the screen from the
dataset/train/88_42.wav|phone entirely.
dataset/train/88_43.wav|Replacement iPhone 11 Pro screens are around $170 right now. So I imagine the iPhone 12
dataset/train/88_44.wav|Pro will be priced similarly when they start coming out...if Apple doesn't digitally lock
dataset/train/88_45.wav|them to the motherboard making 3rd party repairs impossible, which they seem to be doing more
dataset/train/88_46.wav|of lately.
dataset/train/88_47.wav|There is a smorgasbord of other connectors revealed now that the screen is gone. Connectors
dataset/train/88_48.wav|on top of connectors. So it looks like I'll just be unsnap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap,
dataset/train/88_49.wav|snap, snap, snap, snap, snapping them just like little Legos. The last one is taped to
dataset/train/88_50.wav|the top of the motherboard so I'll peel it back and move it out of the way before we
dataset/train/88_51.wav|head over to the cameras. There are 4 screws holding down the metal plate over the camera
dataset/train/88_52.wav|units. iPhones are always super complex inside and this one requires at least 4 different
dataset/train/88_53.wav|screwdriver bits and a whole lot of organization since pretty much each screw is a different
dataset/train/88_54.wav|size and shape. The top camera is the main one.:the 12 megapixel sensor with optical
dataset/train/88_55.wav|image stabilization. Then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera with no OIS. And the bottom
dataset/train/88_56.wav|12 megapixel 2X optical zoom camera which does have that OIS. You might be asking, 'Hey
dataset/train/88_57.wav|Jerry, what about the lidar sensor?' And that is a great question. We'll get to it in a
dataset/train/88_58.wav|second.
dataset/train/88_59.wav|Still inside of the phone we have the front face ID and the 12 megapixel selfie camera.
dataset/train/88_60.wav|The lidar module is still screwed in and facing the rear of the phone. The brains of the operation,
dataset/train/88_61.wav|the motherboard, has 6 screws holding it in place. The SIM card tray has a white water
dataset/train/88_62.wav|damage indicator sticker over the top grill. This sticker can be seen from outside of the
dataset/train/88_63.wav|phone if you just peek inside of your SIM card tray slot. Apple's pretty smart, their
dataset/train/88_64.wav|phones might be water resistant, but they aren't waterproof. And Apple can tell if it
dataset/train/88_65.wav|ever gets wet when that sticker turns pink.
dataset/train/88_66.wav|There are 2 more ribbons at the bottom of the motherboard. Then the whole thing can
dataset/train/88_67.wav|pull away from the phone. It's another double stacked board again this year, with no thermal
dataset/train/88_68.wav|paste or copper heat pipe. It's just living it's best life with no extra cooling. The
dataset/train/88_69.wav|lidar sensor is held in place by two more screws. Lidar is actually pretty cool. It's
dataset/train/88_70.wav|like a depth sensor on steroids – able to bounce infrared light from one circle and
dataset/train/88_71.wav|measure the bounce back to calculate distances. It makes for some really fast 3D scanning
dataset/train/88_72.wav|and measuring. It's even found in some self driving cars. Here in the iPhone it'll probably
dataset/train/88_73.wav|mostly be used for really fast auto focusing for the camera. But it's still cool to see
dataset/train/88_74.wav|futuristic technology in a mainstream smartphone.
dataset/train/88_75.wav|Now the iPhone battery does have magical pull tabs. But I'm going to bust your bubble and
dataset/train/88_76.wav|just break it to you that I basically broke all of them
dataset/train/88_77.wav|and had to pull the battery out with my bare hands instead. The battery is a bit smaller
dataset/train/88_78.wav|than last year's iPhone 11 Pro, sitting at just 2815 milliamp hours. We also get our
dataset/train/88_79.wav|first look at the top side of the wireless charging coil. Spoiler alert: the other side
dataset/train/88_80.wav|looks way cooler. But first we'll pull out the loudspeaker. It's a gigantic mess down
dataset/train/88_81.wav|here with 10 more different sized and shaped screws and standoffs. But we finally do get
dataset/train/88_82.wav|to lift out the loudspeaker with it's water resistant mesh inside of the opening, as well
dataset/train/88_83.wav|as a new massive orange gasket to help seal up that hole. The SIM card tray is modular.
dataset/train/88_84.wav|Kind of fun.
dataset/train/88_85.wav|The taptic engine is also a bit smaller this year, but interesting fact, Apple plopped
dataset/train/88_86.wav|a Lego-style connector right in the middle of the ribbon. Whoever said Apple doesn't
dataset/train/88_87.wav|innovate has obviously never seen this. Plus there's this thing down here that looks super
dataset/train/88_88.wav|important and I don't even know what it does. If the iPhone looks like a chaotic nightmare
dataset/train/88_89.wav|inside is because it is. The wireless charger is physically tied into the phone's side buttons,
dataset/train/88_90.wav|so I'll unscrew this metal bracket on the side and pull the mute switch through the
dataset/train/88_91.wav|frame. Then finally, after everything, we get our first look under the wireless charging
dataset/train/88_92.wav|pad and glimpse this glorious array of circular magnets around the outside. It's rather brilliant
dataset/train/88_93.wav|of Apple to use magnets to perfectly position the two coils on top of each other. Instead
dataset/train/88_94.wav|of using one large circle magnet, it's actually made up of 18 smaller more rectangular magnets.
dataset/train/88_95.wav|Apple said that every single magnet used in the iPhone 12 is recycled, which is awesome.
dataset/train/88_96.wav|Getting rid of the charging brick, headphones, and making the box smaller is also supposed
dataset/train/88_97.wav|to help out the environment. Fun fact though: creating a brand new smartphone consumes almost
dataset/train/88_98.wav|as much energy as using a smartphone for an entire decade. So since Apple has over 1 billion
dataset/train/88_99.wav|active iPhones on the planet right now, if they really wanted to help the environment
dataset/train/88_100.wav|they'd make their phones easier to repair. I mean, let's be honest, making the box smaller
dataset/train/88_101.wav|is peanuts compared to how much energy we could save by just using our phones for an
dataset/train/88_102.wav|additional year or two. Not much change is between each new version of a phone anyway.
dataset/train/88_103.wav|Of course every step towards helping the environment is a good step. But I would like to see Apple
dataset/train/88_104.wav|facilitating repairs instead of just locking every component to the motherboard and having
dataset/train/88_105.wav|people buy new phones, which seems to be their current trend. The underside of the glass
dataset/train/88_106.wav|can be scratched away, making for a small frosting glimpse into the wireless charger.
dataset/train/88_107.wav|Apple could make one of the coolest clear phones of all time with this coil...but they
dataset/train/88_108.wav|didn't. So I did. Every real detail from the inside of the phone can now be seen from the
dataset/train/88_109.wav|outside without voiding your warranty. Even the magnets. We can see the magnets, the charging
dataset/train/88_110.wav|coil, and even the water damage indicator sticker here on the SIM card tray. And if
dataset/train/88_111.wav|we bring over the magical magnetic MagSafe charger, we can see how the two work together.
dataset/train/88_112.wav|The charging coil plugged into the wall creates a small energy field that the receiving coil
dataset/train/88_113.wav|can receive. Science is pretty cool.
dataset/train/88_114.wav|I'll leave a link for my Teardown Skin down in the video description, along with the Ridge
dataset/train/88_115.wav|Wallet. And I'll get this phone put back together and working again once I find a replacement
dataset/train/88_116.wav|screen. Let me know what you think of Apple's new charging system. Would you ever buy a
dataset/train/88_117.wav|clear iPhone? Let me know down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/88_118.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/89_1.wav|Today we're going to durability test the iPhone 12 Pro and it's ceramic shield covered front screen.
dataset/train/89_2.wav|You might have noticed that the box is a little bit smaller this year.
dataset/train/89_3.wav|You know how Apple has slowly been removing things with each new product launch.
dataset/train/89_4.wav|First was the headphone jack, then the HDMI on their laptops, and now it's the charging
dataset/train/89_5.wav|brick itself that's gone. It's always exciting to find out what's going to disappear next.
dataset/train/89_6.wav|Apple definitely keeps you on your toes. Honestly though, it's probably a good thing. Their 5 watt
dataset/train/89_7.wav|inbox charger was the slowest charger of any phone anywhere. And now there's no reason not to upgrade
dataset/train/89_8.wav|to the faster charging Anker Nano, which costs less while still charging three times faster...all
dataset/train/89_9.wav|while keeping the same size as the old brick. Thanks to Anker for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/89_10.wav|Now iPhone users will get to experience the fast charging that Androids have had
dataset/train/89_11.wav|for years. I'll leave a link down in the video description that will give you a 10% discount
dataset/train/89_12.wav|off the Anker Nano...because you know, if Apple isn't going to hook you up, Anker for sure will.
dataset/train/89_13.wav|Now it's time for the durability test. Let's get started.
dataset/train/89_14.wav|Personally, I think it's a bit sus that Apple got rid of the free inbox charger at the exact same
dataset/train/89_15.wav|time they came out with a new type of magnetic charging...which conveniently costs $40, by the
dataset/train/89_16.wav|way. I'm sure it's all just a coincidence though. Just like how the headphone jack disappeared at
dataset/train/89_17.wav|the same time the wireless airpods came out. You know, totally normal behavior.
dataset/train/89_18.wav|You can see that inside the magnetic circular attachment is a group of coiled wires
dataset/train/89_19.wav|that transfer power to the other set of coiled wires inside of the phone. We'll have to see
dataset/train/89_20.wav|what those look like for realsies when we open them up for the teardown video, but
dataset/train/89_21.wav|while we're here on the outside we can see where the magnets are located with some metal shavings.
dataset/train/89_22.wav|The magnets form a perfect circle around the outside of the copper coils.
dataset/train/89_23.wav|Thumbs up for that. I think it's kind of cool,
dataset/train/89_24.wav|even if you aren't able to keep your credit card and phone in the same pocket anymore.
dataset/train/89_25.wav|It's probably a good idea in general though to keep metal shavings away from your phone.
dataset/train/89_26.wav|If you remember, the earpiece and loudspeaker are also both made with magnets, so if any small
dataset/train/89_27.wav|shavings get sucked up inside of the phone we can tear the speakers to shreds. I'm sure the ip68
dataset/train/89_28.wav|waterproofing will help keep the dust and shavings out. But still, it's better safe than sorry.
dataset/train/89_29.wav|Speaking of being safe rather than sorry,
dataset/train/89_30.wav|Apple has stepped up their phone design quite a bit this year with a lot of focus on the screen.
dataset/train/89_31.wav|Apple says their new ceramic shield is a step beyond glass. But it's as important to listen
dataset/train/89_32.wav|closely to their carefully structured buzzword filled sentences. Apple said they've included
dataset/train/89_33.wav|nano-ceramic crystals within the glass matrix to dramatically improve toughness. And yeah, they
dataset/train/89_34.wav|might have found a new way of forming glass to make it tougher, but those new crystals are still
dataset/train/89_35.wav|within a glass matrix, which means it's still glass no matter how many other words they add to
dataset/train/89_36.wav|the sentence. And if glass is still glass...you know the rest. Apple doesn't mention much about
dataset/train/89_37.wav|scratch resistance, just drop protection and toughness. They also use the phrase “along with
dataset/train/89_38.wav|our new design it makes the iPhone tougher than ever.” So it's not just the new glass.
dataset/train/89_39.wav|I think a large part of that four times more drop resistance comes from the design, with the glass
dataset/train/89_40.wav|totally flush sitting just inside the surface of the frame. A piece of glass has 6 sides:
dataset/train/89_41.wav|front, back, and all 4 edges. And with 5 of those 6 sides protected by this phone frame
dataset/train/89_42.wav|in a way that most smartphones are not built, it really does make this iPhone 12 Pro
dataset/train/89_43.wav|more shatter resistant. So I do believe Apple's claim about the glass being 4 times tougher,
dataset/train/89_44.wav|but I think the protective design has more to do with it than the buzzwords do.
dataset/train/89_45.wav|I've scratched hundreds and hundreds of phones in this exact same way, and Apple's ceramic shield is
dataset/train/89_46.wav|still scratching at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7. It might just be my imagination,
dataset/train/89_47.wav|but it does look like the level 6 scratches are a tad more faint, but they are definitely still
dataset/train/89_48.wav|there. Ceramic shield is not the product that will bring us to the next level of Mohs hardness.
dataset/train/89_49.wav|One thing that can always be certain though, is that as Apple removes things from the box,
dataset/train/89_50.wav|the high price will always remain the same. The only way to really keep your screen scratch free
dataset/train/89_51.wav|and resale value high is with a screen protector.
dataset/train/89_52.wav|I've installed thousands of screen protectors from my pre-YouTube phone repair days,
dataset/train/89_53.wav|and it only takes a few seconds. The biggest obstacle is the dust underneath the glass.
dataset/train/89_54.wav|But there's an alcohol wipe and a dust sticker in the box to help mitigate that.
dataset/train/89_55.wav|The screen protector is held in place by a thin layer of nano adhesive so there's no residue
dataset/train/89_56.wav|left on the glass when it's ever removed. And since the iPhone 12 Pro display is totally flat,
dataset/train/89_57.wav|the precision cut screen protector makes it look like it was meant to be there.
dataset/train/89_58.wav|Just like you wear safety glasses to protect your eyes and a mask to protect your lungs,
dataset/train/89_59.wav|a screen protector is a cheap way to avoid a lot of future regret. I'll leave a link for
dataset/train/89_60.wav|dbrand screen protectors down in the video description. Plus, these aren't your normal
dataset/train/89_61.wav|plastic rubbery screen protectors either. It's an additional layer of protective tempered glass.
dataset/train/89_62.wav|And as we know, glass is glass, and glass can...it's much easier to replace a $10
dataset/train/89_63.wav|screen protector than it is to replace a $270 display. I'll leave that link in the description.
dataset/train/89_64.wav|Now if I'm being totally honest, I do have to say that the iPhone 12 Pro is one of the cleanest
dataset/train/89_65.wav|looking and best feeling phones that I've held in a really long time. And the frame is surprisingly
dataset/train/89_66.wav|hard to scratch. The sides of the iPhone 12 Pro are made from stainless steel, and since
dataset/train/89_67.wav|my razor blade is also made from stainless steel, they're having a hard time damaging each other.
dataset/train/89_68.wav|The paint is obviously still going to scratch off. Most phones are usually made from softer aluminum.
dataset/train/89_69.wav|Aluminum is like a 3 or 4 on Mohs scale. So this stainless steel at
dataset/train/89_70.wav|Mohs 5 is quite a bit more resilient It's just the paint that's not. The silver
dataset/train/89_71.wav|colored version of the iPhone is going to hide this kind of damage the best.
dataset/train/89_72.wav|There is no expandable memory of course. There never was. The magnets on the back can be a handy
dataset/train/89_73.wav|SIM card removal tool holder. And then of course at the bottom we still have our lightning port.
dataset/train/89_74.wav|I'm also a big fan of the textured glass back here.
dataset/train/89_75.wav|You can hear the difference my razor blade makes when it goes
dataset/train/89_76.wav|from the rough frosted texture to the smooth glass on the Apple logo.
dataset/train/89_77.wav|The textured glass has the ability to act like sandpaper to other objects. Since glass is a very
dataset/train/89_78.wav|hard material, softer objects like this penny will leave marks behind on the glass. But the
dataset/train/89_79.wav|marks aren't permanent. It's just dust caught on the rough surface and can be rubbed away.
dataset/train/89_80.wav|The top camera bump is relatively reasonable this year, when compared to Samsung's monstrosities.
dataset/train/89_81.wav|The bottom lens is a 12 megapixel 2x optical zoom telephoto. Then we have
dataset/train/89_82.wav|the 12 megapixel ultrawide in the center. And the main 12 megapixel sensor up top. And each
dataset/train/89_83.wav|camera lens is again covered with its own sapphire crystal lens cover.
dataset/train/89_84.wav|It's still getting marks levels 6 and 7, but you already know how I feel about that.
dataset/train/89_85.wav|The screen of the iPhone 12 Pro is a 6.1 inch super retina XDR display,
dataset/train/89_86.wav|meaning it's OLED. And has a slightly higher resolution than 1080p. A cool thing though
dataset/train/89_87.wav|is that even after 30 seconds from the heat of my lighter, the pixels on the OLED are still unfazed
dataset/train/89_88.wav|with zero damage. Other phones start to turn white and not recover. Now I'm no materials expert,
dataset/train/89_89.wav|but ceramic is a slower conductor of heat than glass is, meaning that the heat doesn't transfer
dataset/train/89_90.wav|through it as easy. So it is possible that Apple's new screen material is keeping the heat away from
dataset/train/89_91.wav|the pixels. This doesn't mean quite a whole lot as far as lighters go, but it does add a little
dataset/train/89_92.wav|validity to the new ceramic crystal material claim that Apple is making. The oleophobic
dataset/train/89_93.wav|coating is definitely evaporated though, so don't try the burn test on your own phone.
dataset/train/89_94.wav|What about the bend test? I mean, it's probably easy to guess, but with the more
dataset/train/89_95.wav|solid stainless steel frame and recessed glass on both sides keeping the box rigid,
dataset/train/89_96.wav|the iPhone 12 Pro is a non-flexing tank of a cell phone and I'm impressed. No bends, kinks,
dataset/train/89_97.wav|or cracks of any kind in the frame. Apple is, and always has been, premium and expensive,
dataset/train/89_98.wav|but at least lately the materials have started to match the price tag a bit better.
dataset/train/89_99.wav|I used my last phone for over 3 years, and I've only had my current phone for about a year,
dataset/train/89_100.wav|so I'm not ready to upgrade just yet. Maybe someday I'll try out the iPhone again, but I'll
dataset/train/89_101.wav|wait until next year's iPhone 13 Pro Max Ultra Pro 6G no screen edition before I make up my mind.
dataset/train/89_102.wav|I'll leave links in the description for that stuff Apple forgot to include, like the charger and
dataset/train/89_103.wav|screen protector. Let me know what you think of Apple's new phone down in the comments.
dataset/train/89_104.wav|You cool with them leaving out the charger? Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/89_105.wav|And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/9_1.wav|Today we're taking apart my still fully functional Samsung Z Flip 4.
dataset/train/9_2.wav|We're going to see if we can find out what made that popping noise during the durability test,
dataset/train/9_3.wav|and what's keeping it from closing all the way currently. It should be a very interesting
dataset/train/9_4.wav|dissection. And I think this time around we will with the neon green JerryRig Knife. And I think
dataset/train/9_5.wav|the next ones we will run out of are the metal and the clear. No pressure of course, I'm just
dataset/train/9_6.wav|letting you know. And as always I'll be shipping these with Stamps.com. Time is super important,
dataset/train/9_7.wav|so when Stamps.com came along and said I could ship everything from my own home I was super
dataset/train/9_8.wav|on board. Stamps.com brings the power of UPS and USPS right to your computer. So whether
dataset/train/9_9.wav|you're a large office sending out invoices, have a small side hustle with Etsy or eBay,
dataset/train/9_10.wav|or you're just a really cool YouTuber sending out razer knives, Stamps.com can handle it all. And I
dataset/train/9_11.wav|would definitely know because I've shipped a lot of things. Time is more important now
dataset/train/9_12.wav|with the holiday season sneaking up. Instead of driving to the post office or standing in line,
dataset/train/9_13.wav|I can now spend time with my family or make more videos. Don't just take my word for it though,
dataset/train/9_14.wav|Stamps.com is the 24/7 post office you can access from anywhere. Used by over 1 million
dataset/train/9_15.wav|businesses. Saving time is the most important to me, but the massive discounts, up to 86%,
dataset/train/9_16.wav|and the ability to compare carriers is just icing on the cake. All you need is a normal printer,
dataset/train/9_17.wav|a normal computer, and the link down in the description: Stamps.com/Jerryrig. You'll get
dataset/train/9_18.wav|free postage, a free 4-week trial, and a free 5 pound digital scale, all with no long term
dataset/train/9_19.wav|commitments or contracts. Just how we like it. The link is down in the description.
dataset/train/9_20.wav|Stamps.com/Jerryrig. And now I think it's time for the Z Flip 4 to say goodbye. Let's get started.
dataset/train/9_21.wav|I mean, obviously, I'm going to put in quite a bit of effort to keep our flippy boy alive,
dataset/train/9_22.wav|but you've seen how it goes with these things. Gotta be realistic.
dataset/train/9_23.wav|A few people suggested in the durability test video that I should just take off the exterior
dataset/train/9_24.wav|plastic screen protector. And normally I do on regular phones. But if you remember the
dataset/train/9_25.wav|long laundry list of restrictions included in the warning screen the first time we turn this
dataset/train/9_26.wav|on. Removing the protective film on the main display was one of the things it specifically
dataset/train/9_27.wav|said not to do. But now that the tearing down time has begun, we can do it and see what
dataset/train/9_28.wav|happens. The clear protective layer is adhered slightly stronger than a regular plastic screen
dataset/train/9_29.wav|protector. But so far the screen and everything else is still alive after taking it off.
dataset/train/9_30.wav|In all likelihood, the top layer can probably be removed and another protective
dataset/train/9_31.wav|layer installed without anything going wrong. But with how fragile that center screen is,
dataset/train/9_32.wav|it's just not really worth the risk. I'd rather have a few divots than a non-functional screen.
dataset/train/9_33.wav|That would be my recommendation for you. For me, however, risk is my middle name
dataset/train/9_34.wav|and the theme of today's video. I'm going to try and disassemble and reassemble this
dataset/train/9_35.wav|Flip 4 in one piece. Something I have yet to accomplish with any other folding phone.
dataset/train/9_36.wav|Starting with the plastic bumpers we can get those out of the way. I noticed that the screen's ribbon
dataset/train/9_37.wav|cables are folded around the bottom edge of the display which means that if we start lifting from
dataset/train/9_38.wav|the other side, the top, and make sure not to flex the screen in more than one direction at a time,
dataset/train/9_39.wav|we might be able to get it off successfully. A little heat is our friend to help soften
dataset/train/9_40.wav|the adhesive holding the display to the body, and then we can go to town.
dataset/train/9_41.wav|The first thing to notice during the removal is that while Samsung did ditch the metal backing
dataset/train/9_42.wav|on the flexible Fold 4, that metal plate is still installed here on the Flip 4, which is
dataset/train/9_43.wav|indeed useful to us. The metal plate gives us support back here for when we're prying it away
dataset/train/9_44.wav|from the body. As well, now it can't be punctured from behind like Julius Caesar. (What? Too soon?)
dataset/train/9_45.wav|Making sure to only flex in one direction at a time sinec bi-directional folding is what killed
dataset/train/9_46.wav|the last one, we can peel the Flip screen away from the body, taking special care not to damage
dataset/train/9_47.wav|the ribbons at that bottom edge. Honestly I think we might have just been successful.
dataset/train/9_48.wav|It's still plugged into the motherboard of course,
dataset/train/9_49.wav|but the hardest part is over and it just might live another day. Let's get to the insides and
dataset/train/9_50.wav|see if we can detach everything else just like William Wallace. (What? Too soon?)
dataset/train/9_51.wav|Heat again is our best friend, and with a suction cup and our trusty green razor blade,
dataset/train/9_52.wav|we can separate and lift the glass panel away from the body. The adhesive is mostly just around the
dataset/train/9_53.wav|perimeter. I'm taking special care not to let the tip of my blade point downward so
dataset/train/9_54.wav|we can avoid slicing the battery or damaging any circuitry. The secondary exterior screen
dataset/train/9_55.wav|is also removed the same way. I'm just taking extra care not to stab the edge of the screen
dataset/train/9_56.wav|under the glass since that never ends well. I'm also avoiding putting any stress on the
dataset/train/9_57.wav|ribbon cables as it's lifted off. And the screen ribbon can be detached just like a little Lego.
dataset/train/9_58.wav|With the internals now exposed we can remove 4 silver screws and 2 metal brackets which gives us
dataset/train/9_59.wav|access to the battery plugs, for the top battery as well as the bottom battery. Along with the 15
dataset/train/9_60.wav|watt wireless charger that's also capable of reverse wireless charging at 4.5 watts.
dataset/train/9_61.wav|If we mosey on over to the center hinge, I do see two circular stickers on either
dataset/train/9_62.wav|half that when removed allows us to peer into its depths. But also
dataset/train/9_63.wav|I'm not quite sure why these stickers exist. They wouldn't help much with water proofing,
dataset/train/9_64.wav|so if you have any ideas while they're here, let me know down in the comments.
dataset/train/9_65.wav|I'll remove the 5 phillips head screws from the bottom plastics. Pop that guy off. There
dataset/train/9_66.wav|are balls inside the lower loudspeaker, which we see on pretty much every smartphone these days.
dataset/train/9_67.wav|I'll detach the screen ribbon from that lower circuiboart, along with the gold extension
dataset/train/9_68.wav|ribbon. There's one silver screw and then the 25 watt charging port board is free with its
dataset/train/9_69.wav|red rubber ring around the opening. Nothing too crazy yet. There are waterproofing mesh screens
dataset/train/9_70.wav|over the lower loudspeaker opening and that microphone hole. We also have plenty of magnets
dataset/train/9_71.wav|and a coinstyle vibrator motor. The top plastics have another 6 screws holding them in place.
dataset/train/9_72.wav|Nothing special here either, just plastic. We do, however, see our 10 megapixel selfie
dataset/train/9_73.wav|camera's sensor since the unit is glued in place and now it's destroyed. Normally these
dataset/train/9_74.wav|cameras aren't glued in so tight, but here we are with that little Easter egg. There is no OIS.
dataset/train/9_75.wav|Coming back down to the phone again, we see our power button has its own silver bracket
dataset/train/9_76.wav|and the same gasket style construction as the power and fingerprint scanner on
dataset/train/9_77.wav|the Fold 4. Samsung is obviously sharing tech between the two which is to be expected. The
dataset/train/9_78.wav|motherboard can also be removed at this point...If you remember to take out the SIM card tray, which
dataset/train/9_79.wav|I obviously have. Then we have the 12 megapixel ultra wide camera with no OIS and the 12 megapixel
dataset/train/9_80.wav|normal camera which does have the optical image stabilization. There is no thermal paste or foam
dataset/train/9_81.wav|on the back of the board which is interesting, just the large graphite pads placed beneath the
dataset/train/9_82.wav|circuits. One thing I'm not going to do this time around is remove the batteries since Samsung is
dataset/train/9_83.wav|rather rude with their adhesion...glue-aholics you might even say. Samsung makes safe battery
dataset/train/9_84.wav|removal impossible. And since our Flip has at least a 9% chance of surviving all of this,
dataset/train/9_85.wav|I'm going to leave the combined 3700 milliamp hour capacity batteries intact.
dataset/train/9_86.wav|The flexible screen though, hopefully still in one piece and functioning,
dataset/train/9_87.wav|can be fully removed from the phone at this point, and when left at rest with no forces acting on it,
dataset/train/9_88.wav|there is a slight natural curve in the center. And that natural curve is supported by the rubber and
dataset/train/9_89.wav|metal slats that we've seen in previous years. I'm not going to get too crazy with it at the
dataset/train/9_90.wav|moment though since I think this year is legit our first actual chance of getting this phone back to
dataset/train/9_91.wav|life – just like Frankenstien. (Too soon?) If we look at the guts of last year's Flip 3 we can see
dataset/train/9_92.wav|the internal gears doing their tiny rotations as they keep the two halves opening and closing with
dataset/train/9_93.wav|equal resistance. But if we take a look at the new Flip 4 and remove its graphite thermal tape,
dataset/train/9_94.wav|we can see that the Flip is indeed gearless this time around and instead is using the
dataset/train/9_95.wav|metal channels to guide the phone uniformly as it opens and closes with Samsung's new hinge
dataset/train/9_96.wav|design. So the Flip 4 did get its hinge upgraded even if the screen has the same
dataset/train/9_97.wav|structural components as the last generation. It's hard to say for sure what caused that
dataset/train/9_98.wav|super large pop during the bend test or what kept the phone from fully closing after the
dataset/train/9_99.wav|test was over since everything feels and looks fluid from in here on the inside.
dataset/train/9_100.wav|If I had to pick the most creative and innovative phone so far this year it would definitely be the
dataset/train/9_101.wav|Samsung folding phones. Yeah it's not the flying car future we were promised by cartoons growing
dataset/train/9_102.wav|up, but the technology is still incredibly cool even if it is super fragile. I have my hopes up
dataset/train/9_103.wav|that this guy is still alive. With the motherboard back in place and its plastic screwed down we can
dataset/train/9_104.wav|poke the screen ribbon cable through the phone body and attach it to the charging port board
dataset/train/9_105.wav|before dropping into place the bottom loudspeaker plastics. I forgot to point out that we still have
dataset/train/9_106.wav|that rubbery goop keeping the phone watertight. This goop probably also doubles as protection for
dataset/train/9_107.wav|the ribbon so they aren't chafing on the metal. The wireless charging pad is on along with the
dataset/train/9_108.wav|metal plates. And moment of truth...it has indeed survived. The Flip 4 Folding Phone has suffered
dataset/train/9_109.wav|through a complete durability test, a teardown, and has returned to the land of the living.
dataset/train/9_110.wav|Rather impressive engineering and construction from Samsung. There has never been a phone so
dataset/train/9_111.wav|strong, yet so weak in all of existence. And Samsung should be proud of their creation.
dataset/train/9_112.wav|I'll toss the rear display back on so we can make sure everything is functional. And indeed it is.
dataset/train/9_113.wav|The Samsung Z Flip 4 is as good as new. Thumbs up for that. Of course it would have been way easier
dataset/train/9_114.wav|to see the insides if I would have just slapped on one of my Teardown Skins. {Snap} Link down in the
dataset/train/9_115.wav|description. But sometimes it's not about taking the easiest path. It's all about the friends we
dataset/train/9_116.wav|meet along the way. I think it was Mr. Dahmer who said that. (That one's probably too soon.)
dataset/train/9_117.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with
dataset/train/9_118.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/90_1.wav|Rumor has it that OnePlus has snuck two batteries inside of the OnePlus 8T this year
dataset/train/90_2.wav|to sped up it’s charging time. Instead of one battery charging at 30 watts like last year,
dataset/train/90_3.wav|it’s now two batteries totaling 65 watts.
dataset/train/90_4.wav|I say we go find them and see what they look like from the inside. Let’s get started.
dataset/train/90_5.wav|This is the Aquamarine Green version of the 8T. I still think it looks more blue than anything else.
dataset/train/90_6.wav|After all the crazy phones we’ve been dealing with like the Wing, Fold, and Duo,
dataset/train/90_7.wav|it’ll be nice to open up a normal phone for a change. With some heat and gentle slicing we
dataset/train/90_8.wav|can remove the back glass and fold it open like a book. Nothing special is attached to the glass.
dataset/train/90_9.wav|The inside of the phone has the NFC coil near the top, but no wireless charging.
dataset/train/90_10.wav|There are 16 normal Phillips head screws holding the whole phone together. I’ll link the tool kit
dataset/train/90_11.wav|I’m using down in the video description. I’ll unplug the rear flash and top sensor,
dataset/train/90_12.wav|then the top black plastics can come away from the phone,
dataset/train/90_13.wav|along with the bottom plastics and the built-in loud speaker. There is no waterproofing on the
dataset/train/90_14.wav|speaker unit. The mesh is on the frame as you’ll see in a second. The speaker does have foam balls
dataset/train/90_15.wav|inside. These balls dampen the sound and make the speaker box sound bigger than it actually is.
dataset/train/90_16.wav|Now you might be thinking, ‘Hey Jerry, it looks like there’s only one battery inside of this
dataset/train/90_17.wav|phone.’ And you’re right. But appearances can be deceiving. We took the liberty of changing
dataset/train/90_18.wav|the battery back to red with our Teardown Skin, like OnePlus used to do with the OnePlus One and
dataset/train/90_19.wav|OnePlus Two. I’m sure there’s some kind of make batteries great again joke in here somewhere, but
dataset/train/90_20.wav|since the last guy who said something similar is a joke, we’ll just avoid the subject altogether.
dataset/train/90_21.wav|Up at the top we have some graphite tape and copper covering the silver shields.
dataset/train/90_22.wav|OnePlus has even added thermal paste on the top side to keep things running efficiently.
dataset/train/90_23.wav|Kind of fun. We make the Teardown Skin an exact representation of the actual
dataset/train/90_24.wav|insides. I’ll put a link for the Skin down in the video description.
dataset/train/90_25.wav|There’s a pretty good chance we’ve already made one to cover your phone.
dataset/train/90_26.wav|I’ll unplug the battery and the two long extension ribbons. Both pop off like little Legos. There are
dataset/train/90_27.wav|two screws holding down the motherboard. I can remove the front facing 16 megapixel camera.
dataset/train/90_28.wav|There’s no OIS on this guy, but it does have electronic image stabilizing.
dataset/train/90_29.wav|Now for the battery. If you look closely at the non-red battery you can see a crease down
dataset/train/90_30.wav|the center. There are actually two halves, two batteries, but they’re packaged as one,
dataset/train/90_31.wav|with one joint or seam down the center. Each of the halves have 2250 milliamp hour capacities for
dataset/train/90_32.wav|a total of 4500. Now I’m no lithium expert, but it does seem to be standard across the board that
dataset/train/90_33.wav|most phones don’t charge faster than 30 watts. So it’s probably safe to say that charging a
dataset/train/90_34.wav|singular battery with more power than that might cause the battery to explode or catch fire.
dataset/train/90_35.wav|But doubling up the batteries allows for double the power to be utilized. Tesla kind of uses
dataset/train/90_36.wav|the same principle in their electric cars. A Tesla doesn’t have just one large battery under the car,
dataset/train/90_37.wav|it’s actually six or seven thousand tiny little batteries that can all be charged
dataset/train/90_38.wav|simultaneously very quickly. The copper cooling system of the 8T also extends beneath the battery
dataset/train/90_39.wav|and might help with cooling. I’ll show you that in a second. The bottom SIM card tray board can
dataset/train/90_40.wav|come away. It’s got some screws holding it down. Then the USB-C charging port can come
dataset/train/90_41.wav|up. It’s on a ribbon all of its own and super easy to replace. It also has it’s own red rubber
dataset/train/90_42.wav|ring around the tip for the water resistance, even though there is no official IP rating.
dataset/train/90_43.wav|The square vibrator is down here as well, placed right here in the center of the phone above the
dataset/train/90_44.wav|under screen fingerprint reader. It’s a haptic style vibrator. The under screen fingerprint
dataset/train/90_45.wav|scanner is probably one of those flat sensor types without a lens and we’d have to break off the
dataset/train/90_46.wav|screen in order to see it. I’ll disconnect the 4 Lego style ribbons that surround the rear cameras
dataset/train/90_47.wav|and I’ll pull the whole thing out from the motherboard since
dataset/train/90_48.wav|they’re all joined into the same metal housing.
dataset/train/90_49.wav|We have the 16 megapixel ultra wide camera up top with no OIS. Then we have the main
dataset/train/90_50.wav|48 megapixel sensor which does have optical image stabilization. Then we have the 5 megapixel macro
dataset/train/90_51.wav|camera with no OIS, and the 2 megapixel monochrome which also does not have OIS.
dataset/train/90_52.wav|Finally we can get the motherboard out and away from the phone. Where Samsung is now not using any
dataset/train/90_53.wav|thermal paste on their motherboards, OnePlus has doubled down and doubled up, splattering thermal
dataset/train/90_54.wav|goo all over the back of the motherboard, as well as a few dollops on the front. We can see that
dataset/train/90_55.wav|the paste rests directly on top of the copper heat pipe which extends below the battery.
dataset/train/90_56.wav|The copper can take the heat from the processor and the battery as well, I assume, and then
dataset/train/90_57.wav|release it out the front of the display. Camera sensors are known to heat up as well. So there
dataset/train/90_58.wav|is some graphite tape and copper underneath. But it doesn’t seem to be a part of the vapor chamber.
dataset/train/90_59.wav|Now I’m always torn at this point since I do like seeing the vapor chambers in their entirety.
dataset/train/90_60.wav|But in order to do so, I would have to remove the screen which kills the phone.
dataset/train/90_61.wav|And I should probably leave this one alive since I definitely killed the last few phones that came
dataset/train/90_62.wav|across my desk- The Fold 2 and the Duo. We can still check out a few more things though
dataset/train/90_63.wav|like the waterproofing mesh over the loudspeaker holes in the bottom. And we can also slice
dataset/train/90_64.wav|open the vapor chamber to see the little droplets of liquid inside near the bottom.
dataset/train/90_65.wav|Since we don’t want any sharp objects underneath the battery when we put it back in,
dataset/train/90_66.wav|I’ll just rip off the rest of the copper flap and lay the plastic layer back on top. Sharp objects
dataset/train/90_67.wav|and lithium don’t play super well together. Now we can put everything back together and hope it still
dataset/train/90_68.wav|turns on. I think this OnePlus 8T is the fourth phone that OnePlus has released this year. And
dataset/train/90_69.wav|while it’s definitely still worth a glance with its incremental improvements, you know, if your
dataset/train/90_70.wav|current phone is out of commission, personally I’d be okay if smartphone companies stopped releasing
dataset/train/90_71.wav|3 or 4 versions of the same phone every year, and just focused on one or two more solid devices.
dataset/train/90_72.wav|But I guess more variations reduce the overall risk of one design tanking. And they get their
dataset/train/90_73.wav|brand out in front of people with each new release wave. Brand awareness is pretty priceless.
dataset/train/90_74.wav|Either way, with everything turned on. It’s functioning like normal. Kind of nice to have
dataset/train/90_75.wav|a phone living again after a tear down. I’ll leave a link for the Teardown Skin
dataset/train/90_76.wav|down in the video description. And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/90_77.wav|Thanks a ton for watching. I’ll see you around.
dataset/train/91_1.wav|The OnePlus 8T. OnePlus is pumping out smartphones quicker than most other brands.
dataset/train/91_2.wav|About every 6 months there's a main phone, then the upgraded T model. And sometimes
dataset/train/91_3.wav|there's even a pro model floating around – all with slight variations and minor improvements.
dataset/train/91_4.wav|It does get a little confusing. This time the main change they've made with the 8T is adding
dataset/train/91_5.wav|65 watts of warp charging, which can fully charge the battery in just 39 minutes. Pretty cool – not
dataset/train/91_6.wav|gonna lie. But is it worth the upgrade? There's only one way to find out. Let's get started.
dataset/train/91_7.wav|There was a survey done recently of 2000 people in Britain where 90% of them said buying the
dataset/train/91_8.wav|latest smartphone is a waste of money. Now those would usually be fighting words on a
dataset/train/91_9.wav|tech channel that reviews smartphones, but I'd have to say this time I actually agree.
dataset/train/91_10.wav|The OnePlus 8T does come with a plastic screen protector pre-installed. The reason I say I agree
dataset/train/91_11.wav|is because smartphones depreciate ridiculously fast. Of course my phones do depreciate faster
dataset/train/91_12.wav|than most. But on average, a smartphone loses 40-80% of it's value in the very first year
dataset/train/91_13.wav|of ownership. So buying a new phone, if your old phone is still working just fine, is not a
dataset/train/91_14.wav|financially smart idea. It'll still be scratching at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7.
dataset/train/91_15.wav|The front facing camera is a 16 megapixel hole punch, and the speaker grill up top is made from
dataset/train/91_16.wav|plastic glued into place. I mean, don't get me wrong, the 8T does have a lower price point than
dataset/train/91_17.wav|other flagships which is great. Starting at $750, there is more bang for your buck here than there
dataset/train/91_18.wav|is with Samsung or Apple. But just by getting last year's OnePlus 7T instead of this year's 8T,
dataset/train/91_19.wav|we could save hundreds of dollars because they really both do pretty much the exact same things.
dataset/train/91_20.wav|We'll bump the mute switch to silent because silence is bliss.
dataset/train/91_21.wav|The frame is metal yet again. Along with the power button and the mute switch.
dataset/train/91_22.wav|This is the Aquamarine Green version of the 8T. It definitely looks more blue than green to me,
dataset/train/91_23.wav|and reminds me quite a bit of the Blue Marble Nord that came out a few months ago.
dataset/train/91_24.wav|The bottom of the phone does have its loudspeaker, USB-C port for the 65 watt charging, and the
dataset/train/91_25.wav|removable SIM tray with its rubber waterproof ring. There is no official IP rating this time
dataset/train/91_26.wav|around. I mean, if your current phone is falling apart or not working, by all means it's time
dataset/train/91_27.wav|to get another one. But in the last few years of smartphones, there really haven't been many earth
dataset/train/91_28.wav|shattering improvements. There is still glass on the back with a bunch of cameras just like we saw
dataset/train/91_29.wav|on the 7T. Except this time OnePlus ditched the telephoto camera and went with the macro instead.
dataset/train/91_30.wav|The 16 megapixel wide angle camera is up top. Then the 48 megapixel main sensor, and the 5 megapixel
dataset/train/91_31.wav|macro camera down at the bottom. The monochrome sensor is 2 megapixels and off to the side.
dataset/train/91_32.wav|At least the camera bump isn't the size of Mount Everest like we've seen on some other flagships.
dataset/train/91_33.wav|I guess what I'm trying to say is for the price of this new phone,
dataset/train/91_34.wav|you could go buy yourself an ice cream cone at McDonald's every day for 2 whole years.
dataset/train/91_35.wav|And as we all know, ice cream cones are way more delicious than cell phones.
dataset/train/91_36.wav|If you do get a new phone though, or just want to make your old phone look way cooler,
dataset/train/91_37.wav|there's always my Teardown Skins. I can't comment on the nutritional value,
dataset/train/91_38.wav|but it does come in Original and Ultra Matte. I kind of like the Original myself. We are so
dataset/train/91_39.wav|fast with these that if you order one right now, it'll probably get delivered before the OnePlus 8T
dataset/train/91_40.wav|even starts shipping. I'll put a link down in the video description. Don't get me wrong, buying new
dataset/train/91_41.wav|tech is fun and I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from doing what they want with their
dataset/train/91_42.wav|hard earned money. The only real issue I have with the OnePlus 8T is the fingerprint sensor.
dataset/train/91_43.wav|It keeps saying the fingerprint scanner is dirty, even though that portion of
dataset/train/91_44.wav|the display is scratch free and brand new. The 8T ultimately doesn't even register my thumb.
dataset/train/91_45.wav|Now granted, it's probably my fault since my hands are not pristine, but that's just
dataset/train/91_46.wav|something to factor into your phone buying decisions if you work with your hands a lot.
dataset/train/91_47.wav|The second major improvement on the 8T alongside that 65 watt warp charging, is the 120 Hertz
dataset/train/91_48.wav|refresh rate on the 6.5 inch screen. Some people get real excited for stuff like this. Personally,
dataset/train/91_49.wav|I wouldn't pick that as my main reason for upgrading. Just like I wouldn't pick it for
dataset/train/91_50.wav|the 30 seconds of fire resistance. It's more of a perk to me and not a direct selling point.
dataset/train/91_51.wav|One thing that is pretty important though is durability. The OnePlus 7T didn't totally
dataset/train/91_52.wav|survive my durability test. Nor did the OnePlus Nord earlier this year. And when your phone costs
dataset/train/91_53.wav|$750 ice cream cones, it needs to be structurally sound. Lucky for us though, and lucky for OnePlus,
dataset/train/91_54.wav|the 8T does survive my bend test. There is a little flex to the frame, but no cracks,
dataset/train/91_55.wav|bends or kinks. There is some slight separation in the back glass panel, but no catastrophic damage.
dataset/train/91_56.wav|It'll be cool to see the dual battery setup inside for that fast charging during the tear down.
dataset/train/91_57.wav|OnePlus is back at it with another good phone and it's definitely worth an upgrade if your
dataset/train/91_58.wav|current phone is dead. But if it's not, let's just grab some ice cream and wait for next year.
dataset/train/91_59.wav|Snag a Teardown Skin for your current phone at the link in the description. Come hang out with
dataset/train/91_60.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/92_1.wav|Today we're going to take apart the new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 – one of the most over-engineered
dataset/train/92_2.wav|smartphones of all time. I'm not complaining though. It just means there's more for us
dataset/train/92_3.wav|to look at inside. We'll start by turning it off and then turning it right back on again,
dataset/train/92_4.wav|cuz today we're going in live. Let's get started.
dataset/train/92_5.wav|Any responsible phone repair technician or manufacturer would advise against what we
dataset/train/92_6.wav|are about to do, but if we want to learn more about the limits of Samsung's flexible screen
dataset/train/92_7.wav|technology, we have to know at what point the screen will, you know, pass on from
dataset/train/92_8.wav|this mortal existence. We'll start by removing the plastic border around the interior display.
dataset/train/92_9.wav|This is a buffer to keep out dust, as well as keep the phone halves from clicking together
dataset/train/92_10.wav|when it's folding shut. It's got a bead of copper wire inside to help with the structure,
dataset/train/92_11.wav|as well as little clips and glue holding it to the phone frame. Definitely stronger than last
dataset/train/92_12.wav|year's afterthought of a border. At the center crease there is a little buffer of foam that
dataset/train/92_13.wav|slips in the crack between the two halves. This might be what helped keep the dust out
dataset/train/92_14.wav|during the durability test. I hear there are new bristles inside the hinge, so we'll have to find
dataset/train/92_15.wav|those once we're done with the screen. The screen is still alive at this point. So far, so good.
dataset/train/92_16.wav|If it's anything like last year's Fold 1, we know that there is a bunch of adhesive underneath.
dataset/train/92_17.wav|So we'll warm that up with the heat gun. And then I'll use my razor blade to lift up on the
dataset/train/92_18.wav|metal plates supporting each half. You'll notice that if my razor is underneath that metal plate,
dataset/train/92_19.wav|nothing happens. But if my razor accidentally goes through the plastic layers into the screen,
dataset/train/92_20.wav|the pixels instantly die. So we'll avoid stabbing the pixels. And everything stays
dataset/train/92_21.wav|pretty much intact until we start lifting up the half of the screen that's unglued.
dataset/train/92_22.wav|The center spine of the Z Fold has started to freak out a bit. This is definitely not
dataset/train/92_23.wav|indicative of a potential flaw or overly fragile device. Removing that plastic edge piece is like
dataset/train/92_24.wav|removing an arm or a leg. It's a very vital piece of the screen, and I'm already impressed with how
dataset/train/92_25.wav|long it's lasted without it. You can see the front facing camera picking up through the display as
dataset/train/92_26.wav|it gets lifted up and down. Kind of fun. Thumbs up for that. I'll warm up the other half of the
dataset/train/92_27.wav|display and then use my same razor blade trick underneath the metal plate to pry it off in
dataset/train/92_28.wav|working condition. It's a flexible folding display so we should be able to bend it up as long as we
dataset/train/92_29.wav|don't touch the edge too much...you know...since we removed that edge protection. And, well,
dataset/train/92_30.wav|we touched the edge. See where my thumb is? Without that edge protection, the whole line
dataset/train/92_31.wav|of pixels is now toast because I squeezed the edge of the screen. With a few more carefully
dataset/train/92_32.wav|placed slices we are able to remove the rest of the adhesive holding the screen to the body,
dataset/train/92_33.wav|and all we're left with is the ribbon cable that connects the display to the internal motherboard.
dataset/train/92_34.wav|As a side note, about 1 in 4,000 people suffer from photosensitive epilepsy, so just a heads
dataset/train/92_35.wav|up to those guys that this next bit might get a bit flashy. The flexible display does have a
dataset/train/92_36.wav|limit to how much it can fold. You'll notice that every folding screen has a wide curve at the point
dataset/train/92_37.wav|where it folds, like the Flex Pi or the Z-Flip. It does not tightly double over on top of itself
dataset/train/92_38.wav|because when it is doubled over it kills the pixels. Too tight of a fold also should
dataset/train/92_39.wav|break the ultra thin glass layer underneath the top plastic. And indeed, that's exactly
dataset/train/92_40.wav|what we're seeing. Obviously the screen is super excited about this new development.
dataset/train/92_41.wav|But if we look closely, we can see super tiny cracks all along the tight fold I made in the
dataset/train/92_42.wav|folding display. These hairline fractures are definitely underneath the top soft plastic layer.
dataset/train/92_43.wav|To get to them I can slide my razor blade very carefully between the clear top plastic layer
dataset/train/92_44.wav|and the pixels so we can get a better look at that thin glass underneath.
dataset/train/92_45.wav|Gotta admit it looks pretty cool. The pixels die like a runaway ink stain.
dataset/train/92_46.wav|The top camera is still working by the way. It's just the screen that's kind of having a moment.
dataset/train/92_47.wav|The folding glass is very much more visible at this point since it's all
dataset/train/92_48.wav|shattered and busted a bit. It definitely is ultra thin.
dataset/train/92_49.wav|Kind of cool. As much fun as that was though, I think it's time we turn off the phone and open
dataset/train/92_50.wav|it up like a normal person so we can get a better look at the internal hinge and those new bristles.
dataset/train/92_51.wav|First things first, the Teardown Skin's gotta come off. Link in the description.
dataset/train/92_52.wav|Then we can use the old heat gun/razor blade combo to remove the screen.
dataset/train/92_53.wav|Just for the record, repair shops usually have large hot plates and suction machines do this a
dataset/train/92_54.wav|bit safer and more efficiently. So if your phone ever does break, don't think every repair guy is
dataset/train/92_55.wav|running around with a hair dryer. There are real tools for this kind of thing. Once the
dataset/train/92_56.wav|adhesive is cut around the outside I'll just turn it on real quick to make sure I didn't
dataset/train/92_57.wav|break anything...since, you know, the rest of the phone is in such pristine condition.
dataset/train/92_58.wav|Looks great. Once it's off again I can pop out the rubber stopper over the screen ribbon,
dataset/train/92_59.wav|remove the screen and head over to the only place on this phone without a screen.
dataset/train/92_60.wav|A little more heat and slicing removes the back glass. It comes away in one piece. It's got a
dataset/train/92_61.wav|small little microphone on the back camera lens. This is either for better video audio or just for
dataset/train/92_62.wav|noise canceling. With the exteriors removed we can now see the 24 visible Phillips head screws.
dataset/train/92_63.wav|And the additional 2 screws hidden up underneath the wireless charger. With the screws all gone,
dataset/train/92_64.wav|we get the wireless and reverse wireless charger removed. It communicates through the little circle
dataset/train/92_65.wav|pads that just rest on top of the motherboard. And we can unplug the battery. If you notice up here,
dataset/train/92_66.wav|my Z Fold 2 5G is missing the internal 5G millimeter wave antennas, cuz not every version
dataset/train/92_67.wav|of the Z Fold 2 5G will ship with those installed. Samsung is a pro though at giving different
dataset/train/92_68.wav|versions of their phones to different markets without disclaimers. So nothing super new here.
dataset/train/92_69.wav|The other half has a cavity for the top loudspeaker. You can see the earpiece
dataset/train/92_70.wav|is also built into the same piece of plastic. Even though the phone is not water resistant,
dataset/train/92_71.wav|we still see the water proofing mesh over the top of the speaker opening, and the foam balls as
dataset/train/92_72.wav|well are still inside underneath the red sticker. The bottom piece of plastic has the other stereo
dataset/train/92_73.wav|speaker and is also full of those same sound dampening balls we see in higher end speakers.
dataset/train/92_74.wav|I'll disconnect the right battery. And if we take a look at the internal folding screen we can see
dataset/train/92_75.wav|it pops up through the frame right here above the battery and plugs in just like a little Lego.
dataset/train/92_76.wav|With the large screen removed, we get our first look at the silver metal structural side supports
dataset/train/92_77.wav|and the copper layer which I imagine helps keep the whole screen cool.
dataset/train/92_78.wav|The coolest thing besides that though is the center portion.
dataset/train/92_79.wav|Since a solid piece of metal would be too stiff to bend, Samsung has used little sticks of aluminum
dataset/train/92_80.wav|like a fence, or one of those roll up bamboo yoga mats. This gives the flexible screen support
dataset/train/92_81.wav|and only lets it bend in one direction. These little details on the inside are pretty cool.
dataset/train/92_82.wav|We still haven't found the internal bristles yet, so let's disconnect the side button ribbons
dataset/train/92_83.wav|and the 4 larger extension ribbons that connect the circuit boards all to each other.
dataset/train/92_84.wav|After removing one more screw at the bottom, the charging port board can come away from the phone.
dataset/train/92_85.wav|The USB-C port can fast charge at 25 watts and has its own water damage indicator sticker
dataset/train/92_86.wav|on the back. This will turn pink if the phone ever gets wet. The Z-Fold 2 has no ip rating.
dataset/train/92_87.wav|Now we can remove the right motherboard, the green one, with its top inside front facing camera,
dataset/train/92_88.wav|which is identical...which is identical in size and shape to the 10 megapixel
dataset/train/92_89.wav|camera that points out the exterior front screen.
dataset/train/92_90.wav|It's interesting that their Lego style connectors are also both blue and green, but don't match up
dataset/train/92_91.wav|with the blue and green boards they are plugged into. They are probably interchangeable though.
dataset/train/92_92.wav|There are two more screws holding in the blue main board, and once that's lifted off, we see the
dataset/train/92_93.wav|graphite cooling pad. We'll talk about that more in a second. All of the rear cameras on the Z Fold
dataset/train/92_94.wav|2 are 12 megapixels. The ultra wide camera up top, the regular camera with OIS in the center, and the
dataset/train/92_95.wav|12 megapixel telephoto camera down at the bottom, which also has the optical image stabilization.
dataset/train/92_96.wav|Now for the graphite pad. Samsung doesn't talk about this much, or at all.
dataset/train/92_97.wav|But we found during my cooling system swap between the Exynos and the Qualcomm processors,
dataset/train/92_98.wav|that the type of cooling doesn't have much of a difference on the heat transfer.
dataset/train/92_99.wav|The copper vapor chamber behaved pretty similarly to these layers of paper thin graphite so it's not
dataset/train/92_100.wav|too big of a deal. Interestingly enough though, reports are that every single one of the Z Fold
dataset/train/92_101.wav|2's will be equipped with the more powerful Qualcomm processors instead of the Exynos chips.
dataset/train/92_102.wav|So at least that performance dip isn't something you'll need to worry about with this $2,000 phone.
dataset/train/92_103.wav|It's just the $1300 phones you gotta watch out for.
dataset/train/92_104.wav|The SIM card tray has its own cute little board. An SD card would have been cool too,
dataset/train/92_105.wav|but it is what it is. Now the part that I hate most about Samsung phones are the batteries.
dataset/train/92_106.wav|While every other phone manufacturer is using normal adhesive, or magic pull tabs,
dataset/train/92_107.wav|Samsung likes to show off the world's strongest glue. One piece of this stuff
dataset/train/92_108.wav|would have kept the Titanic from sinking. I'd like to ask, where is this battery going to go,
dataset/train/92_109.wav|Samsung? If you were strapping the battery to a Mars Rover, this amount of glue would make sense.
dataset/train/92_110.wav|But the phone is already sealed shut and the most velocity it's ever going to encounter
dataset/train/92_111.wav|is falling on someone's face after an hour of sleep scrolling. The glue is definitely overkill.
dataset/train/92_112.wav|I'll add some isopropyl alcohol underneath the battery to dissolve the adhesive now
dataset/train/92_113.wav|that it's exposed. But still, I shouldn't need to invoke a chemical reaction to remove my battery.
dataset/train/92_114.wav|The larger battery is 2,345 milliamp hours. And the smaller battery is 2,155 milliamp hours.
dataset/train/92_115.wav|I'm just going to leave that one in the frame. Finally,
dataset/train/92_116.wav|the hinge. Some hinges are simple, like the Microsoft Duo, or the Motorola Razr,
dataset/train/92_117.wav|but Samsung likes to show off some engineering prowess and I'm not complaining.
dataset/train/92_118.wav|There are 5 screws holding on a center plate, which once removed exposes the underside of the
dataset/train/92_119.wav|two flexible ribbons running through each half. These ribbons only have to flex 180 degrees,
dataset/train/92_120.wav|so they are just the regular ribbons. Interesting to note though that the Microsoft Duo also had two
dataset/train/92_121.wav|ribbons connecting the halves. And it's ribbons were made from the stringy metal that flexes
dataset/train/92_122.wav|360 degrees. It's interesting to see the ways different companies can solve the same issue.
dataset/train/92_123.wav|I'll remove three more screws from the bottom, and another three at the top. And once those extension
dataset/train/92_124.wav|ribbons are unstuck from the frame, we get our first look at the hinge cavity and the long line
dataset/train/92_125.wav|of bristles that sit just inside the hinge. It's a super fine line of short little brushes that
dataset/train/92_126.wav|allow enough space for the hinge to flex while still keeping a pretty decent seal against dust,
dataset/train/92_127.wav|as we saw from the durability test video. It's impressive that such a little and probably
dataset/train/92_128.wav|inexpensive addition can solve such a large problem. The rest of the hinge is relatively
dataset/train/92_129.wav|similar to last year's. It still has it's long metal spine whose color is customizable this
dataset/train/92_130.wav|time around. And still has a bunch of those super tiny gears. And internal coils that regulate the
dataset/train/92_131.wav|force required to open and close the halves. I'm impressed. Between this and the LG Wing, and the
dataset/train/92_132.wav|Microsoft Duo, 2020 has been a pretty great year for uniquely built phones. Yeah, my Z Fold 2 might
dataset/train/92_133.wav|not be alive anymore, but at least we got to see how it worked from the inside. So rest in peace.
dataset/train/92_134.wav|A much less expensive and less catastrophic way to see the inside of your phone of course,
dataset/train/92_135.wav|would be to just grab one of my Teardown Skins from dbrand. It's a fraction of the
dataset/train/92_136.wav|cost with all of the pleasure. We have skins for over 50 different devices now,
dataset/train/92_137.wav|so I'll leave a link down in the description. What's your favorite phone that we've taken
dataset/train/92_138.wav|apart this year? Let me know down in the comments. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/92_139.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/93_1.wav|The $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is here. Samsung has tweaked a few things with the
dataset/train/93_2.wav|design this time around, including a larger front screen, and adding a new supposedly
dataset/train/93_3.wav|dust-resistant hinge. I think, you know, we should test that out. Let's get started.
dataset/train/93_4.wav|There are a few more changes inside the box this time around as well. No more free wireless
dataset/train/93_5.wav|earbuds. But they do include the corded USB-C headphones that I don't think I've ever seen
dataset/train/93_6.wav|anyone use in real life. There is a 25 watt fast charger in the box, but most importantly,
dataset/train/93_7.wav|this year's Fold 2 comes with even more warnings than last year's Fold 1. They added a no fingernails
dataset/train/93_8.wav|warning which that one was probably my fault, it's also still not water resistant. And down
dataset/train/93_9.wav|here they added a do not remove the screen protector warning which we can probably still
dataset/train/93_10.wav|blame on MKBHD.
dataset/train/93_11.wav|Now of course I wouldn't publicly say it's kind of nice to get my own warning label due
dataset/train/93_12.wav|to my durability tests, but privately I would probably say that's kind of cool. The rest
dataset/train/93_13.wav|of the phone looks pretty similar to last year's. There's still a small gap between
dataset/train/93_14.wav|the two halves when it's folded closed. The biggest difference is probably the exterior
dataset/train/93_15.wav|screen, which is way larger than last year's version. We'll get to the internal screen
dataset/train/93_16.wav|in just a second. Let's start with the scratch test.
dataset/train/93_17.wav|The new exterior screen of the Z Fold 2 is almost two inches larger. And as we can see
dataset/train/93_18.wav|from the level 3 scratches, it's covered with a very nice plastic screen protector. Underneath
dataset/train/93_19.wav|that screen protector though, the elongated screen appears to be made of glass – Gorilla
dataset/train/93_20.wav|Glass Victus to be exact. And as we start to make our way up through the Mohs scale
dataset/train/93_21.wav|of hardness, we see scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7. Just like
dataset/train/93_22.wav|most other flagships on the market today. So far it's about what we expected.
dataset/train/93_23.wav|Let's move onto the middle screen. I'll take special care not to accidentally poke the
dataset/train/93_24.wav|screen this time around, since as we learned last year, sharp stabs tend to kill it. The
dataset/train/93_25.wav|inner display is pretty much the same size as last year's, just this time around there's
dataset/train/93_26.wav|no notch up in the corner, just a hole cut out for the front facing camera. It's a little
dataset/train/93_27.wav|more futuristic looking. It does look like there's more than one screen protector installed
dataset/train/93_28.wav|though. A semi-temporary rubber screen protector placed on top of the more permanent plastic
dataset/train/93_29.wav|layer. I'm definitely not saying this one should be removed though since Samsung very
dataset/train/93_30.wav|specifically said none of them were removable. But it kind of appears like this top one isn't
dataset/train/93_31.wav|super important or structural.
dataset/train/93_32.wav|Once again underneath that we're still seeing scratches at a level 2, with deeper grooves
dataset/train/93_33.wav|at a level 3. The hardness of the folding display has not changed. Samsung still does
dataset/train/93_34.wav|say there is a layer of ultra thin glass on the Fold 2, and there probably is, it's just
dataset/train/93_35.wav|under this thick top plastic display. We'll have to dig around for it during the teardown
dataset/train/93_36.wav|when I pull the display completely off of the phone. But yes indeed, the Galaxy Fold
dataset/train/93_37.wav|2 can still be damaged by a fingernail. The soft plastic screen isn't a deal breaker of
dataset/train/93_38.wav|course, it's just important to know how durable a phone is before you start using it, which
dataset/train/93_39.wav|is kind of why I'm here.
dataset/train/93_40.wav|The phone frame is still made from aluminum. No complaints there. There is a SIM card tray,
dataset/train/93_41.wav|but no expandable memory unfortunately. The bottom of the Fold 2 has its loudspeaker and
dataset/train/93_42.wav|USB-C port. The volume rocker is made from metal. But we'll wait on the fingerprint scanner
dataset/train/93_43.wav|for a bit later in the video.
dataset/train/93_44.wav|Up top there is a microphone and another speaker. As a side note, if $2000 is a bit hard to
dataset/train/93_45.wav|swallow and you still want a folding phone, you can always just get a Fold from last year
dataset/train/93_46.wav|which does pretty much the exact same thing and now costs substantially less since there's
dataset/train/93_47.wav|a new version now. A penny saved is a penny earned.
dataset/train/93_48.wav|The back of the phone does have wireless and reverse wireless charging, along with it's
dataset/train/93_49.wav|12 megapixel telephoto camera at the bottom, 12 megapixel normal camera in the center,
dataset/train/93_50.wav|and another 12 megapixel ultra wide camera up top, all protected by glass. There's also
dataset/train/93_51.wav|a 10 megapixel selfie camera on the front display and on the inner display. Cameras
dataset/train/93_52.wav|are kind of all over the place on this thing and obviously the massive iconic camera bump
dataset/train/93_53.wav|is still there to match the rest of Samsung's 2020 phones.
dataset/train/93_54.wav|The hinge design is not very simple, unlike the Microsoft Duo or the Motorola Razer, but
dataset/train/93_55.wav|it is made from metal. Inside the Fold is a highly complex and complicated conglomerate
dataset/train/93_56.wav|of choreographed high caliber cogs in concise conditions, to hopefully avoid capitulating
dataset/train/93_57.wav|to any cantankerous calamities. You know how it is.
dataset/train/93_58.wav|The Samsung logo is inlaid with shiny letters. Kind of fun. And of course there is the thin
dataset/train/93_59.wav|plastic ridge around the inside display to keep the two halves from clanking shut on
dataset/train/93_60.wav|top of each other. One thing that's found fairly common here on planet earth is...earth.
dataset/train/93_61.wav|Might even be safe to say that every country has a bit of it. So it's important that a
dataset/train/93_62.wav|phone be able to survive a bit of dust and dirt since it's everywhere. With a highly
dataset/train/93_63.wav|scientific assortment of pebbles and dust that I found that one time I went outside.
dataset/train/93_64.wav|We can see if any of it will make it's way inside of the hinge. Samsung supposedly added
dataset/train/93_65.wav|some bristles inside to help keep the dust clear. And so far it appears to be working.
dataset/train/93_66.wav|The opening motion is still as smooth as it was when I pulled it out of the box.
dataset/train/93_67.wav|We'll blow it off for good measure. And still nothing. Nice work Samsung. We'll try one
dataset/train/93_68.wav|more time since I still have some more rocks left. But so far it's handling the dust way
dataset/train/93_69.wav|better than last year's model. We'll definitely have to check out those bristles from the
dataset/train/93_70.wav|inside during the teardown. Something that isn't working real great though is the fingerprint
dataset/train/93_71.wav|reader. Apparently it doesn't like dirt on itself, nor on my finger. It took a really
dataset/train/93_72.wav|long time for it to even register my fingerprint. And once we added some scratches to it...it
dataset/train/93_73.wav|was completely game over. The fingerprint scanner on the Z Fold 2 is pretty picky and
dataset/train/93_74.wav|not scratch or dust resistant.
dataset/train/93_75.wav|Another improvement over last year's Fold is the interior 120 Hertz refresh rate. It
dataset/train/93_76.wav|seems like every year those numbers just keep getting higher and higher. Kind of like the
dataset/train/93_77.wav|global temperature. The inner AMOLED screen lasted 15 seconds under the heat from my lighter.
dataset/train/93_78.wav|You can see the plastic has warped a bit from the heat. The outer screen though is way more
dataset/train/93_79.wav|interesting. After about 15 seconds we get an awesome glowing red looking asteroid thing.
dataset/train/93_80.wav|Which quite honestly is the only calamity we haven't seen yet in 2020. At this rate
dataset/train/93_81.wav|we'll probably get one by Christmas. And even though 2020 has been crazy, I've been a pretty
dataset/train/93_82.wav|big fan of the phones that have come out.
dataset/train/93_83.wav|The Z Fold 2 is definitely one of the coolest. The only thing that would make it better though
dataset/train/93_84.wav|is if you could see the inside from the outside. Now, I'm a little biased of course, since
dataset/train/93_85.wav|this is my own Skin I've created with dbrand. But the insides of the Z Fold 2 look pretty
dataset/train/93_86.wav|amazing. Our Teardown Skin is like an x-ray inside of the phone that doesn't void any
dataset/train/93_87.wav|warranties. I've had a Teardown Skin on my own phone for the last year or so, and we've
dataset/train/93_88.wav|got Teardown Skins designed for more than 50 different devices now. I leave little Easter
dataset/train/93_89.wav|eggs in the design like “do not disassemble, bend, or send to Jerry Rig Everything.”
dataset/train/93_90.wav|Or the more important one: “Vote November 3rd.” And the “glass is glass” written
dataset/train/93_91.wav|on the blue ribbon. There are a few other things you'll have to find for yourself. I'll
dataset/train/93_92.wav|leave a link down in the description so you can grab a Teardown Skin for your own device.
dataset/train/93_93.wav|Now it's time for the bend test. The hinge is still working great at this point, even
dataset/train/93_94.wav|after everything. And the phone can indeed handle a few slams. But the finely tuned hinge
dataset/train/93_95.wav|still has me worried. Even though it did survive last year for the most part, it's still rather
dataset/train/93_96.wav|unnerving to see something that looks so fragile be so strong. And this year's Galaxy Fold
dataset/train/93_97.wav|2 is no different. Bending the Fold the wrong direction reveals the impious amounts of strength.
dataset/train/93_98.wav|Logic would imply that the phone would snap right down there in the middle. But here we
dataset/train/93_99.wav|are with the uncrackable cracker. Nice work science. This phone might scratch easier than
dataset/train/93_100.wav|chocolate on a sunny day, and cost more than Trump's taxes, but it is most definitely built
dataset/train/93_101.wav|extremely well. I still think if you want to save some money you can just get last year's
dataset/train/93_102.wav|version. But either way, I've got a Teardown Skin made for both of them. And I'll put the
dataset/train/93_103.wav|link in the description.
dataset/train/93_104.wav|Let me know what you think of the Fold. Are you ready for the future? Or do you think
dataset/train/93_105.wav|the price needs to drop substantially before it's more appealing? Let me know down in the
dataset/train/93_106.wav|comments. Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on
dataset/train/93_107.wav|Instagram and Twitter. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/94_1.wav|In front of us we have one of my favorite phones that I'll never end up using – the
dataset/train/94_2.wav|Microsoft Surface Duo. It's my favorite because of its uniqueness and simplicity. But I'll
dataset/train/94_3.wav|also never end up using it because of that same simplicity. Today we're going to open
dataset/train/94_4.wav|up the Surface Duo and see how it works from the inside, paying special attention to that
dataset/train/94_5.wav|hinge. Let's get started.
dataset/train/94_6.wav|The hinge of the Microsoft Duo is pretty awesome. It's simple, no moving parts, and it's 360
dataset/train/94_7.wav|degree functionality allows for more screen positions than any other folding phone out
dataset/train/94_8.wav|there at the moment. To get access to the internals we're going to have to remove the
dataset/train/94_9.wav|dual AMOLED displays. And this is where things start to get tricky. Smartphone displays are
dataset/train/94_10.wav|fragile and not usually meant to come off. Yeah, with some heat we can soften the adhesive,
dataset/train/94_11.wav|but one wrong move can crack the top glass or start delaminating the display portion
dataset/train/94_12.wav|from the underside of the glass, which then kills the screen. Microsoft has not made this
dataset/train/94_13.wav|Duo easy to repair. I can make the final slice down the spine side of the display. And once
dataset/train/94_14.wav|the screen is totally loose, I'll turn it on to inspect the damage. And it looks like
dataset/train/94_15.wav|even though the glass is intact with no cracks, we did end up breaking the screen. And by
dataset/train/94_16.wav|“we,” I mostly mean me.
dataset/train/94_17.wav|The dead area of pixels are delaminated and will never come back. Now normally during
dataset/train/94_18.wav|these tear downs I like to have the phone survive and be fully functional when I reassemble
dataset/train/94_19.wav|them, but unfortunately not everyone is going to make it...which is also the theme of the
dataset/train/94_20.wav|US covid response...but we'll keep going for the sake of future historians.
dataset/train/94_21.wav|Both of the screens are the exact same. Each has a 5.6 diagonal and are super thin thanks
dataset/train/94_22.wav|to being AMOLED. And I'm not going to lie, this thing looks pretty great inside. I'm
dataset/train/94_23.wav|not sure if Microsoft has sold enough of these Duos to warrant a Teardown Skin yet, but I'm
dataset/train/94_24.wav|a pretty big fan of the internals. I'll unclip the smaller of the two batteries. The larger
dataset/train/94_25.wav|battery does not have a visible disconnect. It might be underneath the smaller circuit
dataset/train/94_26.wav|board. I'll remove the six T4 screws holding that board down, then I can unclip the very
dataset/train/94_27.wav|interesting looking wire cable running through the hinge. It's just like a ribbon cable except
dataset/train/94_28.wav|for this time it's made up entirely of little metal wires instead, which probably makes
dataset/train/94_29.wav|it way more durable than a standard ribbon since it does have to live a lifetime of always
dataset/train/94_30.wav|flexing 360 degrees, it's kind of got to be strong.
dataset/train/94_31.wav|We'll get a closer look at these in just a second. There's another one running up through
dataset/train/94_32.wav|the top hinge. Once that latch is lifted up and disconnected, the smaller board can come
dataset/train/94_33.wav|away from the phone revealing both attachment points for those hinge wires and a white water
dataset/train/94_34.wav|damage indicator near the bottom. The massive battery itself still does not have a Lego
dataset/train/94_35.wav|style plug, just a large ribbon with gold contact pads. We haven't seen this kind of
dataset/train/94_36.wav|connector-less battery connector before in a cell phone so that's kind of interesting.
dataset/train/94_37.wav|The battery itself is not easy to remove. Remember, bending the battery kills the battery
dataset/train/94_38.wav|since there are tons of thin layers inside of the pouch. And when those layers get crushed
dataset/train/94_39.wav|together, the battery is never really normal again. Underneath the battery though is 7
dataset/train/94_40.wav|long adhesive strips. Imagine all the fun we could have had if Microsoft had just made
dataset/train/94_41.wav|these pullable like we saw inside of the iPhone...you know, repairable.
dataset/train/94_42.wav|On the top side of the battery we get a little message: This component cannot be easily replaced
dataset/train/94_43.wav|by the user. And whose fault do you think that is, Microsoft? It probably took more
dataset/train/94_44.wav|time and effort to print the apology on the battery than it would have to just make the
dataset/train/94_45.wav|battery removable. I'll set down the 2707 milliamp hour battery and move over to it's
dataset/train/94_46.wav|smaller 755 milliamp hour counterpart – which is also very securely taped into place. This
dataset/train/94_47.wav|time around the battery tape is stuck to more graphite tape, but yeah, the repairability
dataset/train/94_48.wav|of this phone could definitely be improved for the next version.
dataset/train/94_49.wav|Let's continue making our way towards the hinge. There are 11 screws holding down the
dataset/train/94_50.wav|motherboard. And an additional 4 screws holding down the charging port. All of these are still
dataset/train/94_51.wav|the T4 screws. I'll leave a link for the toolkit I'm using down in the video description. There's
dataset/train/94_52.wav|another layer of graphite tape over the top of the motherboard, along with some copper
dataset/train/94_53.wav|foil underneath that – all for the heat dissipation. I'll remove the SIM card tray,
dataset/train/94_54.wav|the bottom microphone, and then I can work on the cool new wire cable ribbon that allows
dataset/train/94_55.wav|both halves of the phone to communicate with each other. And finally, with everything disconnected,
dataset/train/94_56.wav|we can slowly peel the motherboard out from the frame. Behind the motherboard is more
dataset/train/94_57.wav|graphite tape and even more copper foil, which helps the heat escape through the back glass
dataset/train/94_58.wav|panel. The camera is still attached to the motherboard at this point, along with the
dataset/train/94_59.wav|earpiece. On some phones this earpiece would double as a stereo speaker, but that's not
dataset/train/94_60.wav|the case with this Duo. I'll show you the loudspeaker in just a second.
dataset/train/94_61.wav|The tiny front facing camera is definitely a tiny front facing camera. All of its 11
dataset/train/94_62.wav|megapixels get focused through this super small lens and it has a super small footprint
dataset/train/94_63.wav|without any optical image stabilization. The camera is definitely a weak point on this
dataset/train/94_64.wav|phone. The yellow square in its satellite dish over here is the front flash. And unfortunately,
dataset/train/94_65.wav|down here at the bottom of the motherboard is the USB-C port. It's permanently attached.
dataset/train/94_66.wav|The Microsoft Surface Duo does have a series of magnets around the outside, probably to
dataset/train/94_67.wav|help keep the phone closed when it's folded. Now it's time for the hinge, the last piece
dataset/train/94_68.wav|of hardware we want to analyze. The hinge is the thing that kept this whole phone from
dataset/train/94_69.wav|snapping during the bend test, and it's the only majorly structural component inside of
dataset/train/94_70.wav|the Duo. We'll remove the 6 screws down at the bottom and another 6 screws up at the
dataset/train/94_71.wav|top. We can see that the cool looking wire cables are free floating inside of that hinge.
dataset/train/94_72.wav|Nothing is able to pull apart yet though, which means there are probably a few more
dataset/train/94_73.wav|hidden screws underneath the white back glass panel. We can make short work of that with
dataset/train/94_74.wav|our heat gun and razor blade. Microsoft has added a ton of adhesive back here to hold
dataset/train/94_75.wav|everything together, but with a bit of aggressive persuasion we can get that back panel off
dataset/train/94_76.wav|in one piece.
dataset/train/94_77.wav|With the back panel gone we get our first look at the singular loudspeaker here on the
dataset/train/94_78.wav|left side as well as those tiny screws we were looking for. There are 7 of them running
dataset/train/94_79.wav|lengthwise down the edge of the hinge. These T2 screws help keep the strong hinge attached
dataset/train/94_80.wav|to the weaker body panel. The plastic frame itself is also molded into the ends of the
dataset/train/94_81.wav|hinge kind of like hinge caps, which can pretty easily pop off so we can get a better look
dataset/train/94_82.wav|at how the hinge works. We've seen a lot of folding devices, like the Royal Flex Pi, the
dataset/train/94_83.wav|Z-Fold, the Z-Flip, and the iPad Pro. But this Duo is most like the Motorola Razer,
dataset/train/94_84.wav|yet surprisingly, even more simple. The long cnc'd metal bar has a small channel on top
dataset/train/94_85.wav|for those cool wire connectors to connect both halves of the phone together. And it's
dataset/train/94_86.wav|definitely made from metal since it bends and holds its shape. The friction fit end
dataset/train/94_87.wav|caps are what allows the hinge to fold into its unlimited number of positions, while at
dataset/train/94_88.wav|the same time allowing space on the inside for those wires to flex with the screen and
dataset/train/94_89.wav|not get pinched. There are also no moving parts or gears that can catch dust or rocks,
dataset/train/94_90.wav|you know, that junk up the mechanism. It's a pretty simple and smart design.
dataset/train/94_91.wav|The Duo gets duo thumbs up from me...even if I won't actually end up using it as my
dataset/train/94_92.wav|personal device. I think Microsoft has proven that they are more than capable of making
dataset/train/94_93.wav|a folding phone. And if the next version, the Duo 2, includes better cameras, I'll be
dataset/train/94_94.wav|way more tempted into using it. Either way though, make sure you're subscribed so you
dataset/train/94_95.wav|don't miss any of my future teardowns. I do promise most of them usually survive...most
dataset/train/94_96.wav|of the time. And thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/95_1.wav|The LG Wing is probably one of the most unique devices we've seen all year...or maybe even
dataset/train/95_2.wav|of all time. It's one of those devices that, well, blazes its own trail without really
dataset/train/95_3.wav|stopping to ask for directions. And I'm all for it. This is a pre-production unit sent
dataset/train/95_4.wav|to me by LG – so it's not a retail unit. The durability test has to wait until that
dataset/train/95_5.wav|comes out like we always do. But the hardware is finalized so we can take it all apart and
dataset/train/95_6.wav|see how it works. Huge thanks to LG for sponsoring this video and sending over the Wing. Rather
dataset/train/95_7.wav|brave of them since I've never opened up a phone like this before. And there's a pretty
dataset/train/95_8.wav|good chance it won't survive. Let's get started.
dataset/train/95_9.wav|The LG Wing has about the same size, shape, thickness and weight as my Note 10 Plus inside
dataset/train/95_10.wav|of its case. But the LG Wing can do this...which is something I never thought a phone would
dataset/train/95_11.wav|need to do. Instead of folding, this guy swivels. It'll be super interesting to see how that
dataset/train/95_12.wav|works from the inside.
dataset/train/95_13.wav|The phone splits in half, swiveling up into a t-shape so the screen is horizontal while
dataset/train/95_14.wav|revealing a secondary square screen down below. The swinging motion feels solid and really
dataset/train/95_15.wav|easy to initiate. And something catches the screen at the top of the swivel to gently
dataset/train/95_16.wav|ease it into place. We're going to find out how the hinge works once we get inside. LG
dataset/train/95_17.wav|has installed a high lubricity polyacetal which is a lubricated plastic of sorts that
dataset/train/95_18.wav|surrounds the front panel and protects the screen. It's a softer, smoother plastic raised
dataset/train/95_19.wav|up to form a slight cavern inside so foreign materials won't be rubbing up on the screen
dataset/train/95_20.wav|when it's closed or opening. This is important because pocket sand is a real danger to glass
dataset/train/95_21.wav|displays.
dataset/train/95_22.wav|When the phone is opened up in its winged state, there's more real estate for activities
dataset/train/95_23.wav|and multitasking. Like with YouTube, it displays the video up top and the video controls down
dataset/train/95_24.wav|below. Or when we're in the camera app the bottom display can act as a gimbal for the
dataset/train/95_25.wav|camera unit adding extra electronic stabilization to the camera. There is no physical movement
dataset/train/95_26.wav|of the camera hardware while you're controlling that gimbal. It's all done with software,
dataset/train/95_27.wav|but still pretty cool.
dataset/train/95_28.wav|Activating the top camera makes it pop out of the phone like a daisy, and then the Wing
dataset/train/95_29.wav|can film forwards and backwards at the same time. It also has the same retract and fall
dataset/train/95_30.wav|protection features that we've seen in other pop-up cameras. The coolest thing though,
dataset/train/95_31.wav|I think, is the ability to watch a video full screen while another app like texting is open
dataset/train/95_32.wav|at the bottom. Or even the ability to comment on a video while it's still full screen. Or
dataset/train/95_33.wav|maybe while you're on a road trip, navigation can be vertical while the music is over on
dataset/train/95_34.wav|the side screen. There are a lot of different options. I mean, let's be honest, this probably
dataset/train/95_35.wav|isn't going to be the best phone to recommend to grandma. But if you're looking for the
dataset/train/95_36.wav|latest, craziest, and most uniquely designed phone on the market, this might just very
dataset/train/95_37.wav|well be it.
dataset/train/95_38.wav|Now that the Wing has been awake for 5 minutes, it's time to take it apart. So keep in mind
dataset/train/95_39.wav|that this is my first time seeing the LG Wing and it is very different from any other phone
dataset/train/95_40.wav|we've taken apart recently. So cross your fingers for our new friend's survival.
dataset/train/95_41.wav|The LG Wing has passed 9 different mil standard 810g tests – one of which is the shock test,
dataset/train/95_42.wav|which dropped the Wing at 26 different angles from 1.2 meters and it still survived. But
dataset/train/95_43.wav|that's obviously quite a bit different than being completely dismantled. I'll remove the
dataset/train/95_44.wav|back glass panel since that's where I'd assume we'd find the screen and internal connectors,
dataset/train/95_45.wav|along with whatever magic makes up that swivel hinge.
dataset/train/95_46.wav|With the back glass gone, we get our first look at the wireless charging pad, and the
dataset/train/95_47.wav|no dogs allowed sticker which is good. Since I'm not a canine I'll continue. There are
dataset/train/95_48.wav|9 normal Phillips head screws holding down the top plastics. And once that panel is removed
dataset/train/95_49.wav|we get our first tease at how LG has assembled the Wing. We know ribbon cables can flex,
dataset/train/95_50.wav|you know, from those pop-up cameras. And this ribbon cable controlling the screen goes through
dataset/train/95_51.wav|the PCB and rotates gently with the display inside of its large, smooth, circular opening.
dataset/train/95_52.wav|LG says they've tested this opening motion over 200,000 times. Which, like if you flipped
dataset/train/95_53.wav|open the phone 100 times a day would still last you about 5 ½ years. So far, so good.
dataset/train/95_54.wav|We can also get a close up look at the pop-up front facing camera. It's got the same stepper
dataset/train/95_55.wav|motor setup that we've seen other pop-up cameras use. I used to dedicate an entire video to
dataset/train/95_56.wav|a pop-up camera, but now we've got whole phones splitting in half. Technology is pretty great.
dataset/train/95_57.wav|I'll disconnect the battery, the bottom screen, the USB-C charging port cable, all just like
dataset/train/95_58.wav|little Legos. Then I'll pull out the SIM and expandable memory SD card tray. You might
dataset/train/95_59.wav|think that a phone like this wouldn't have any water protection, and you're kind of right.
dataset/train/95_60.wav|The phone isn't exactly sealed shut. But LG has coated the internal boards with a water
dataset/train/95_61.wav|repellent coating. There's still no official IP rating, so keep it away from water, but
dataset/train/95_62.wav|it is nice to know it does have some protection.
dataset/train/95_63.wav|I'll lift the motherboard out from the phone after disconnecting the 32 megapixel front-facing
dataset/train/95_64.wav|camera. There are 3 rear facing cameras. The 12 megapixel swivel camera up top, a 64 megapixel
dataset/train/95_65.wav|main camera, which does have optical image stabilization, and a 13 megapixel wide angle
dataset/train/95_66.wav|camera down at the bottom. The top camera does the whole gimbal thing that I showed
dataset/train/95_67.wav|you earlier, with its built in electronic stabilization. There is a small thermal pad
dataset/train/95_68.wav|on the back which helps transfer heat away from the processor into the frame of the phone.
dataset/train/95_69.wav|I'll take the battery out next before we try to remove the wing. There is an incredibly
dataset/train/95_70.wav|reasonable amount of adhesive holding the battery down. No magic pull tabs. But it does
dataset/train/95_71.wav|pop up easily with my pry tool. Thumbs up for that. It has a 4,000 milliamp hour capacity.
dataset/train/95_72.wav|We have a few more revelations about that hinge from this vantage point. The little
dataset/train/95_73.wav|doohickey that cushions the hinge opening is right here next to the display ribbon.
dataset/train/95_74.wav|It's the smallest hydraulic damper I've ever seen. Hydraulic shocks are common on trucks
dataset/train/95_75.wav|and off-roading vehicles to help cushion the impact of the vehicle while off-roading. And
dataset/train/95_76.wav|here we have the babiest of the baby sharks inside of the LG Wing. If we can get an “awe”
dataset/train/95_77.wav|down in the comments that would be great. We'll get a closer look at that guy in just
dataset/train/95_78.wav|a second. In order to get the front screen off, I imagine it has something to do with
dataset/train/95_79.wav|these 6 large Phillips head screws. After those are gone, I can tell the screen wants
dataset/train/95_80.wav|to come away from the phone but it's still connected somehow. I'm trying to be gentle
dataset/train/95_81.wav|since I never really asked LG if they wanted this phone back alive or not. But, they also
dataset/train/95_82.wav|didn't tell me how to open it, so here we are.
dataset/train/95_83.wav|After a lot of unfruitful jiggling and wiggling, I realized that the screen itself had a little
dataset/train/95_84.wav|hole in its sliding mechanism. Kind of like how we would find in a hotel room chain door
dataset/train/95_85.wav|lock. And once I got those internal screws removed, it gets loose enough so the hole
dataset/train/95_86.wav|can be lined up and popped off the body of the phone. I used to, you know, tell my mom
dataset/train/95_87.wav|that video games would help me learn problem solving skills that I could use as an adult.
dataset/train/95_88.wav|And I don't think this is exactly what she had in mind, but I'm still counting it.
dataset/train/95_89.wav|There are 9 black screws holding the hinge to the super thin top display. And once those
dataset/train/95_90.wav|are gone, we finally get our full complete view of the LG Wing hinge. The rest of the
dataset/train/95_91.wav|hinge components are riveted together which makes sense, because what's left inside are
dataset/train/95_92.wav|two pretty powerful springs. One that helps the phone open and hold it open. And the other
dataset/train/95_93.wav|that holds it in a closed position. Both equally balanced so that the swiveling motion itself
dataset/train/95_94.wav|is easy. The large hole in the center is for that ribbon cable. The two curved sections
dataset/train/95_95.wav|you see on the hinge are for the double locking mechanism that keeps the screen from opening
dataset/train/95_96.wav|too far in either direction. And having two of them both made out of metal helps keep
dataset/train/95_97.wav|the screen strongly positioned parallel to the rest of the phone body. It looks like
dataset/train/95_98.wav|our itty bitty hydraulic damper is held in place with three tiny screws of its own. I'll
dataset/train/95_99.wav|pop those out and pull away our tic-tac size little friend. It's amazing how small this
dataset/train/95_100.wav|thing is. The same technology that keeps the screen door from slamming shut is now inside
dataset/train/95_101.wav|of a cell phone. 2020 has been pretty wild.
dataset/train/95_102.wav|Speaking of wild, it's going to be really crazy if I can get this whole thing put back
dataset/train/95_103.wav|together and functioning again.
dataset/train/95_104.wav|I'll feed the top display through the hinge and get that screwed down. The top display
dataset/train/95_105.wav|is 6.8 inches, and the bottom display, which is still attached to the frame, is just about
dataset/train/95_106.wav|4 inches. Getting the curved metal guiding slot in the screen lined up with the metal
dataset/train/95_107.wav|post on the phone body is probably the trickiest part of the reassembly. But once I feel it
dataset/train/95_108.wav|get clicked in, everything else just falls into place exactly how it should. And I can
dataset/train/95_109.wav|attach the spring portion of the swivel hinge back to the frame from the inside. Everything
dataset/train/95_110.wav|else is relatively normal just like a regular phone.
dataset/train/95_111.wav|The motherboard goes back in with its popup camera. And all of the little Lego style ribbon
dataset/train/95_112.wav|attachments get clipped in. I'll lay the battery in place and get the Wing screen ribbon connected.
dataset/train/95_113.wav|Then I can attach the wireless charging and protective back plastics with the screws.
dataset/train/95_114.wav|And trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are. The whole thing still turns on and functions
dataset/train/95_115.wav|like normal. Not too shabby.
dataset/train/95_116.wav|I'm impressed at LG's leap of innovation. The Wing brings some exciting diversity to
dataset/train/95_117.wav|an otherwise rather boring sea of rectangles, and I think it's pretty cool. I'm curious
dataset/train/95_118.wav|to hear your thoughts about the Wing down in the comments. We'll do a durability test
dataset/train/95_119.wav|when the retail version comes out to keep things consistent. I am glad that LG gave
dataset/train/95_120.wav|us an early look inside though.
dataset/train/95_121.wav|Hit that subscribe button if you haven't already. Come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter.
dataset/train/95_122.wav|And thanks a ton for watching, I'll see you around.
dataset/train/96_1.wav|The Microsoft Surface Duo. It's been a while since Microsoft has released a cell phone
dataset/train/96_2.wav|– four years actually. So it's nice to see them come back swinging with a dual screen,
dataset/train/96_3.wav|folding tablet of a smartphone. Today we're going to durability test the Surface Duo right
dataset/train/96_4.wav|alongside the slim pin. This video is sponsored by Audible.
dataset/train/96_5.wav|Let's get started.
dataset/train/96_6.wav|The Surface Duo costs about $1400. And before we get too mad at that massive price, it's
dataset/train/96_7.wav|really kind of justified since it's like two regular phones stuck together. Two screens,
dataset/train/96_8.wav|two batteries, so I won't make fun of the price too much. The bumper case, however,
dataset/train/96_9.wav|does deserve whatever jokes come its way. It's included in the box right alongside the
dataset/train/96_10.wav|18 watt fast charger. And don't get me wrong, it was nice of Microsoft to include some protection.
dataset/train/96_11.wav|As you can tell, this phone is unlike anything else we've ever seen, with a full complete
dataset/train/96_12.wav|360 degree hinge that can close like a book, or open up and have the screen on the front
dataset/train/96_13.wav|and back. So designing an effective physically protective case for this contraption would
dataset/train/96_14.wav|be super complex. I would have liked to attend the meeting though where someone suggested
dataset/train/96_15.wav|just taping rubber strips to the side. I mean, yeah, it'll probably be effective and definitely
dataset/train/96_16.wav|better than nothing. I just didn't see that one coming. Who knows how long it will actually
dataset/train/96_17.wav|stick to the side of the phone for though, which makes this durability test all the more
dataset/train/96_18.wav|important.
dataset/train/96_19.wav|The Duo is shorter than my Note 10 Plus, and also a bit wider and incredibly thin. When
dataset/train/96_20.wav|folded shut it's just about as thick as my phone is inside of my case. Opened up though,
dataset/train/96_21.wav|it feels more like an e-reader with glass on the front and the back. It does feel heavier
dataset/train/96_22.wav|than it looks and I honestly kind of like it.
dataset/train/96_23.wav|The Duo is running Android and acts just like any other Android phone would, except for
dataset/train/96_24.wav|all this extra screen real estate. You can have Twitter open on one half of the phone
dataset/train/96_25.wav|and Instagram open on the other, so it's easier to watch society collapse in real time.
dataset/train/96_26.wav|Before we start the scratch test, let's break open Microsoft's stylus. Now this slim pin
dataset/train/96_27.wav|is sold separately but does work on the Surface Duo, and costs a little over $100. It's got
dataset/train/96_28.wav|its own exterior charging station. Not quite as streamlined as Apple's Apple Pencil, or
dataset/train/96_29.wav|the Samsung S pen inside of the Notes, but to be fair, this Slim pen also doesn't snap
dataset/train/96_30.wav|in half quite as easy as the others do. This guy is a tank.
dataset/train/96_31.wav|I'll start slicing through both plastic sides of the pen, and take a quick break to analyze
dataset/train/96_32.wav|the clicky bit up at the top. Then all the plastics can be removed to reveal a long internal
dataset/train/96_33.wav|metal housing with two magnets built into the sides. The magnets allow itself to perch
dataset/train/96_34.wav|on the side of the Duo. I'm not sure if that's on purpose or not. It doesn't seem like it
dataset/train/96_35.wav|would end up staying there very long.
dataset/train/96_36.wav|I'll remove the two screws and open up the metal sheath and we get our first look at
dataset/train/96_37.wav|quite possibly the cutest battery we've ever seen. This little cylinder is a 15 milliamp
dataset/train/96_38.wav|hour capacity cell made by Panasonic. Takes about 90 minutes to charge and operates the
dataset/train/96_39.wav|pen for about 14 hours. Kind of fun.
dataset/train/96_40.wav|Now let's get into the scratch test. The Duo has dual 5.6 inch displays which fold open
dataset/train/96_41.wav|to reveal an 8.1 inch screen overall. With the hinge and bezel in the middle though it's
dataset/train/96_42.wav|more like a second monitor than an extended display. I've always used multiple monitors
dataset/train/96_43.wav|on my desktop computers though, so I get the appeal.
dataset/train/96_44.wav|The Microsoft Duo is using Gorilla Glass 5, which means it scratches at level 6 with deeper
dataset/train/96_45.wav|grooves at a level 7. I'm strangely drawn to this device. Weird phones have always appealed
dataset/train/96_46.wav|to me. My first phone was a Nokia 6800 with the keyboard on either half of the screen.
dataset/train/96_47.wav|But cameras are also important to me and this phone only has one. One front facing camera
dataset/train/96_48.wav|under the front glass. No camera bump or rear cameras, just the one 11 megapixel little
dataset/train/96_49.wav|guy. There's also only one speaker right here in the earpiece. The grill is secure, but
dataset/train/96_50.wav|one speaker is just not the same as stereo. So the lack of cameras and lack of stereo
dataset/train/96_51.wav|speakers will probably be mostly what keeps me from switching to this phone. Also, very
dataset/train/96_52.wav|strangely for a $1400 device, the frame is made from plastic, as well as the buttons.
dataset/train/96_53.wav|Not a deal breaker by itself, but the thinness of the halves combined with the plastic frame
dataset/train/96_54.wav|does make me nervous for the bend test.
dataset/train/96_55.wav|There is plastic along the top, as well as along the bottom next to that USB-C charging
dataset/train/96_56.wav|port. There is no headphone jack. The Duo does have a SIM card tray but no expandable
dataset/train/96_57.wav|memory. There is no IP rating, but there is a little peak feature which just allows the
dataset/train/96_58.wav|time and date to pop up along the inside edge. Almost like an always on display but on the
dataset/train/96_59.wav|inside.
dataset/train/96_60.wav|The Duo feels more elegant than normal cell phones. Almost like a book. It's more sophisticated.
dataset/train/96_61.wav|And speaking of sophistication, huge thanks to Audible for sponsoring this video. Audible
dataset/train/96_62.wav|is still giving families with children access to hundreds of titles for free while this
dataset/train/96_63.wav|whole pandemic thing is still going on. No ads, no sign up, just one click and you're
dataset/train/96_64.wav|in. Also, I didn't tell you this, but Audible isn't even checking to see if you're a kid
dataset/train/96_65.wav|or not to get those free titles. And there are some really good classics in there like
dataset/train/96_66.wav|Frankenstein or Call of the Wild.
dataset/train/96_67.wav|If you've ever wondered, though, if you could swim inside of a nuclear reactor, you might
dataset/train/96_68.wav|like the audio book called What If out of Audible's regular library. It gives scientific
dataset/train/96_69.wav|answers to hypothetical questions like what would happen if everyone on earth jumped up
dataset/train/96_70.wav|and down at exactly the same time. Makes you kind of curious, huh? Get the What If audiobook

dataset/train/96_74.wav|to Audible for sponsoring this video.
dataset/train/96_75.wav|Now, it might also just be my imagination, but I do feel like this Microsoft Duo will
dataset/train/96_76.wav|regularly just not recognize my finger swipes. The screen would just sit unresponsive when
dataset/train/96_77.wav|I would swipe across it, or try to open and close apps, and I haven't even been that mean
dataset/train/96_78.wav|to it yet. Hopefully it's just a minor software issue.
dataset/train/96_79.wav|Every surface on the Duo is made from glass which does make it feel high-tech since heaviness
dataset/train/96_80.wav|is kind of associated with quality – at least for me. The plastic frame of the phone
dataset/train/96_81.wav|doesn't draw too much attention to itself. Speaking of the plastic frame though, I did
dataset/train/96_82.wav|already scratch the fingerprint scanner a bit on my way around with my razor blade.
dataset/train/96_83.wav|So as I try and set my fingerprint this time, it's having a real struggle getting a good
dataset/train/96_84.wav|read. But once my fingerprint is finally recognized, it does seem to unlock the phone every single
dataset/train/96_85.wav|time.
dataset/train/96_86.wav|The bumper case also has a cut out for the fingerprint sensor. It's still a little bit
dataset/train/96_87.wav|funny that a piece of tape is the only thing holding the case to the phone. As for the
dataset/train/96_88.wav|burn test, Microsoft is using dual AMOLED displays on either half, and we can verify
dataset/train/96_89.wav|that by scientifically holding my lighter to the screen for about 12 seconds and watching
dataset/train/96_90.wav|the display turn white. We still don't quite know why it does this yet, but if we do it
dataset/train/96_91.wav|enough times, we might find out why. Therefore, science.
dataset/train/96_92.wav|Now for the bend test. Microsoft has already done half of my job for me. The phone bends
dataset/train/96_93.wav|incredibly smoothly all the way around. The hinge is super simple and pretty much all
dataset/train/96_94.wav|exposed. We'll take a closer look at how it works from the inside during the teardown.
dataset/train/96_95.wav|Since this phone is wider than most, it might not fit comfortably in most front pockets,
dataset/train/96_96.wav|and people who own it are going to be tempted to put it in their back pocket like a wallet,
dataset/train/96_97.wav|which means there's a good chance that Duo will get sat on. And if it does get sat on,
dataset/train/96_98.wav|it's probably going to do something like this and flex more than any other phone we've seen
dataset/train/96_99.wav|in recent history. When we open it up though, surprisingly it still turns on even though
dataset/train/96_100.wav|there is a permanent curve to the phone now.
dataset/train/96_101.wav|The plastic frame is not helping much with the structural integrity, but the metal hinge
dataset/train/96_102.wav|however, is holding its own and carrying the load. Bending it back the other direction
dataset/train/96_103.wav|we can see that the phone is flexing quite a bit, but not along the hinge. The hinge
dataset/train/96_104.wav|mechanism is made from metal along with the two rods running lengthwise down its spine.
dataset/train/96_105.wav|If the metal hinge was not there, this phone would definitely be toast. The metal is enough
dataset/train/96_106.wav|to keep the phone alive. So the Microsoft Surface Duo passes my durability test.
dataset/train/96_107.wav|I still don't recommend sitting on it, but it's nice to know that the Duo is not super
dataset/train/96_108.wav|fragile. Overall I'm impressed. Plop a few more nice cameras on the back and I could
dataset/train/96_109.wav|very well see myself using version number 2.
dataset/train/96_110.wav|Don't forget to grab your free audiobook from Audible with a link in the description. Hit
dataset/train/96_111.wav|that subscribe button if you haven't already. And come hang out with me on Instagram and
dataset/train/96_112.wav|Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
dataset/train/97_1.wav|So we're going to do a two-for-one this video. The first thing is, I got a new camera so
dataset/train/97_2.wav|I'm testing it out for the first time. Let me know how you like it down in the comments.
dataset/train/97_3.wav|There might be a few hitches here and there. Today we're also going to test the durability
dataset/train/97_4.wav|of the LG Velvet 5G – a sleek looking phone with a detachable second display...which we'll
dataset/train/97_5.wav|take a look at later in the video if the phone survives that long.
dataset/train/97_6.wav|The LG Velvet currently costs only $600. And it's called the Velvet because of the soft
dataset/train/97_7.wav|glow of the foil underneath the back glass. And it's minimalist raindrop-style camera,
dataset/train/97_8.wav|which is rather refreshing after seeing the camel hump on the Note 20 Ultras. We'll get
dataset/train/97_9.wav|a closer look at those cameras in just a second. Let's get started.
dataset/train/97_10.wav|LG isn't playing that race to the largest camera bump game that Samsung and Apple are
dataset/train/97_11.wav|playing. In fact, two of the three lenses are sitting flush with the back glass. Pretty
dataset/train/97_12.wav|sleek. Samsung's over here looking like Pangaea did 200 million years ago. Let's get on with
dataset/train/97_13.wav|the scratch test. You know how it goes.
dataset/train/97_14.wav|LG has been making smartphones for a really long time now. Kind of falling off the radar
dataset/train/97_15.wav|here and there, but for the most part being pretty consistent. I think my brother is even
dataset/train/97_16.wav|using an LG phone. The curved glass screen of this Velvet scratches at a level 6, with
dataset/train/97_17.wav|deeper grooves at a level 7. The teardrop camera notch up here at the top is a 16 megapixel
dataset/train/97_18.wav|little guy that can film in 1080p.
dataset/train/97_19.wav|There is no earpiece grill, just a large cavern of a slit where the stereo sound comes out
dataset/train/97_20.wav|of. The phone is still ip68 water resistant though, so don't let the big hole scare you.
dataset/train/97_21.wav|And it's still made from aluminum so don't let that sound scare you either. It's got
dataset/train/97_22.wav|a dedicated metal Google Assistant button on the side – kind of convenient. It's right
dataset/train/97_23.wav|underneath the individual up and down volume buttons.
dataset/train/97_24.wav|On the right side of the phone we have more metal and a power button. Up at the top we
dataset/train/97_25.wav|have some clear shipping protection so the phone doesn't rub inside of the box. And the
dataset/train/97_26.wav|SIM card tray has a slot for expandable memory. So far this guy's looking pretty good. And
dataset/train/97_27.wav|if we flip the phone around...wait a minute...could it be?
dataset/train/97_28.wav|A headphone jack?! The legend spoke of this relic, but it's been ages since I've seen
dataset/train/97_29.wav|one in person. I thought they were all extinct. LG has taken the tech from 2015 and 2020 and
dataset/train/97_30.wav|made an incredibly thin sandwich out of it...which makes me a bit nervous for the bend test.
dataset/train/97_31.wav|The main camera up top is a 48 megapixel. Then we have the 5 megapixel depth camera
dataset/train/97_32.wav|and an 8 megapixel ultra wide camera down at the bottom. Then the flash is right below
dataset/train/97_33.wav|that, finishing off the raindrop aesthetic with the decreasing circle sizes. It's a single
dataset/train/97_34.wav|colored flash.
dataset/train/97_35.wav|The Velvet does have wireless charging on the back side. And on the front side we have
dataset/train/97_36.wav|the P OLED 6.8 inch 1080p display. It is on the large end of things. And lasts about 25
dataset/train/97_37.wav|seconds under the heat from my lighter before going white. It does mostly recover at the
dataset/train/97_38.wav|end, but there is still permanent damage, which shows us once again that fire is indeed
dataset/train/97_39.wav|bad for cell phones.
dataset/train/97_40.wav|One thing that should be good for cell phones though is fingerprints. I don't have the best
dataset/train/97_41.wav|luck with these since I do stuff with my hands. So my fingers are either dirty, calloused,
dataset/train/97_42.wav|wet, or otherwise unpristine, and this LG Velvet just can't handle it. No matter how
dataset/train/97_43.wav|many fingers I try, there's still no success. Kind of unfortunate. The ultrasonic fingerprint
dataset/train/97_44.wav|sensor on my Note 10 Plus does a slightly better job, but it's still not perfect.
dataset/train/97_45.wav|The test that really matters though is the bend test. LG is still sitting on the antiquated
dataset/train/97_46.wav|thinner is better dataset/train and is only 7.9 millimeters thick. The Velvet is thinner than both the
dataset/train/97_47.wav|iPhone 11 and the Samsung Note 20 Ultra and that thinness definitely shows itself off
dataset/train/97_48.wav|as flexiness in the bend test. With a few creaks and groans, the phone flexes from the
dataset/train/97_49.wav|back and the front, but locks out and doesn't sustain any permanent damage. The back glass
dataset/train/97_50.wav|does separate from the frame, but there are no cracks in the screen like we saw with the
dataset/train/97_51.wav|OnePlus Nord.
dataset/train/97_52.wav|I'm pretty happy with the LG Velvet. It's a Swiss army knife of a smartphone for a relatively
dataset/train/97_53.wav|realistic price. And what makes it even more interesting is the accessory options. LG was
dataset/train/97_54.wav|pretty clever for offering a $200 dual screen case. And I have a theory as to how they can
dataset/train/97_55.wav|make that second screen so cheap. If we plug the phone into the case screen combo, we can
dataset/train/97_56.wav|see that the screen has exactly the same shape cut and notch as the screen from the phone.
dataset/train/97_57.wav|You might say this is for aesthetics so both sides look the same since the camera cutout
dataset/train/97_58.wav|doesn't need to be there on that second display, but I get that LG scored some pretty hefty
dataset/train/97_59.wav|discounts with these extra screens by buying the exact same screen that they used for the
dataset/train/97_60.wav|phone and just putting it in the case instead...avoiding those extra design costs, and utilizing economies
dataset/train/97_61.wav|of scale to maximize profit margins, all while making a useful accessory. LG is playing chess
dataset/train/97_62.wav|while the rest of the smartphone world is playing checkers.
dataset/train/97_63.wav|The second screen can multitask, like watching YouTube videos on one side while texting on
dataset/train/97_64.wav|the other. And the brightness control dims both screens at the same time. The whole body
dataset/train/97_65.wav|is made from plastic so it can protect the phone. And it can fold all the way around
dataset/train/97_66.wav|backwards to get out of the way if you just want to use one screen. Let's see if my theory
dataset/train/97_67.wav|is correct though. I think this second screen can be removed and then plugged directly into
dataset/train/97_68.wav|the main phone since it probably has the same Lego-style connector. The main difference
dataset/train/97_69.wav|would be that the phone glass is curved and this extra screen glass is flat. But it would
dataset/train/97_70.wav|still be interesting to see if it works when we do that full teardown video.
dataset/train/97_71.wav|Removing the screen usually kills the screen, but this Velvet second display has a thin
dataset/train/97_72.wav|bead of glue around the outside. And after some gentle persuasion with my heat and razor
dataset/train/97_73.wav|blade, I can get the screen to lift off in one piece. The long screen ribbon is hidden
dataset/train/97_74.wav|under the backside of this circuit board, but it's interesting to see that the screen
dataset/train/97_75.wav|has the exact same internal cutouts for the fingerprint scanner and front camera that
dataset/train/97_76.wav|the main phone probably has. So it looks so far like my theory is correct. No need to
dataset/train/97_77.wav|go through that RND for the second screen when you can just reuse the first one.
dataset/train/97_78.wav|Once we pop out that blue circuit board, the screen can pull away. We'll try to install
dataset/train/97_79.wav|it on the phone during the actual teardown video. I'm impressed. There are a lot of features
dataset/train/97_80.wav|here for a $600 phone, and it's half the price of other flagships out there. And for only
dataset/train/97_81.wav|$200 more we get a whole second screen. I hope Samsung and Apple are paying attention
dataset/train/97_82.wav|to this.
dataset/train/97_83.wav|Let me know what you think of this contraption down in the comments. And come hang out with
dataset/train/97_84.wav|me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks a ton for watching. I'll see you around.

dataset/train/98_14.wav|a portion of this video.
dataset/train/98_15.wav|Now it's time to see what happened to this Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Let's get started.
dataset/train/98_16.wav|The Samsung Note 20 Ultra. Today we're going to find out what's inside one of the most
dataset/train/98_17.wav|expensive smartphones in the world. First we'll turn it off and pop out the SIM card
dataset/train/98_18.wav|tray. Now the tricky thing with the Note 20 Ultra is that the whole thing is curved on
dataset/train/98_19.wav|both the front and the back glass, which makes stabbing the phone much more difficult. I
dataset/train/98_20.wav|found it easier instead of heating it up and slicing at the bottom, I could instead slice
dataset/train/98_21.wav|from the side of the phone and loosen up the longest portion of adhesive before attempting
dataset/train/98_22.wav|the shorter ends that are tucked inside of the metal frame. The phone is ip68 water resistant
dataset/train/98_23.wav|and the adhesive is super strong just like we normally see with Samsung phones. But eventually
dataset/train/98_24.wav|with enough prying and slicing, the back glass comes away and we can get a glimpse of what
dataset/train/98_25.wav|thirteen hundred dollars can buy us.
dataset/train/98_26.wav|At first glance there is a microphone tucked up right inside the corner of the camera lens.
dataset/train/98_27.wav|We have the long white s pen slot over here on the right side of the phone. This is where
dataset/train/98_28.wav|the s pen would sit inside of the phone if the pen was still alive. We'll take a look
dataset/train/98_29.wav|at that pen's wireless charging pad in just a second.
dataset/train/98_30.wav|I'll remove the 18 Phillips head screws holding everything together. But this time around
dataset/train/98_31.wav|there's something different. Every now and then a smartphone manufacturer will dab some
dataset/train/98_32.wav|Loctite or a thread locker on the screws to keep them from jiggling out. But as you can
dataset/train/98_33.wav|see from this, Samsung has kind of gone overboard with my unit. The whole screw is blue. It's
dataset/train/98_34.wav|a minor detail, but with our 1300 dollar purchase we got a few extra drops of Loctite. Let's
dataset/train/98_35.wav|keep going deeper. I'll pop off the wireless charging. This is a rather cool piece of technology.
dataset/train/98_36.wav|Nothing new here of course, but not only does it have the fast wireless charging to charge
dataset/train/98_37.wav|itself up, but it has 9 watts of reverse wireless charging to help power other devices or headphones.
dataset/train/98_38.wav|Even though it's not totally new, I still think it's a cool feature.
dataset/train/98_39.wav|You can see the thick bands of copper underneath the black tape. I'll set that off to the side
dataset/train/98_40.wav|and unplug the battery, then make my way down to the bottom loudspeaker plastics. We can
dataset/train/98_41.wav|see the metal speaker here on the edge and then the plastic box that holds air around
dataset/train/98_42.wav|it just like how a subwoofer is mounted inside of a speaker box. The air inside that box
dataset/train/98_43.wav|gives the speaker room to breathe and make noise. A trick to making a speaker sound bigger
dataset/train/98_44.wav|than it actually is is to add foam, or in this case, a lot of foam balls. It gives the
dataset/train/98_45.wav|sound waves more surface area to reverberate off of before exiting the phone and hitting
dataset/train/98_46.wav|your ears. Someone can count these little guys for me if they want. There is a lot of
dataset/train/98_47.wav|them and I'm probably going to need a vacuum later.
dataset/train/98_48.wav|I'll remove the screen ribbon just like a little Lego, along with the charging port
dataset/train/98_49.wav|ribbon and the bottom support ribbon. It's interesting to see Samsung do the same thing
dataset/train/98_50.wav|we saw inside of the ROG Phone 3 with the little raised internal boards. This one holds
dataset/train/98_51.wav|the flash and sensors for the rear camera, along with the earpiece speaker which again
dataset/train/98_52.wav|is centered in the center of the phone instead of all the way up at the top. It also has
dataset/train/98_53.wav|a chamber of it's own little foam balls so in theory the stereo sound from the Galaxy
dataset/train/98_54.wav|Note 20 Ultra should be better because they have balls at both ends. You can see the little
dataset/train/98_55.wav|channel for the speaker sound that goes up to the super thin earpiece slot at the top
dataset/train/98_56.wav|of the frame. The top camera is very heavily glued into position which we haven't seen
dataset/train/98_57.wav|before. It's a 10 megapixel selfie camera. I wonder if the camera was a tiny bit too
dataset/train/98_58.wav|small for it's slot so they added the extra glue around the edge to compensate. Calculating
dataset/train/98_59.wav|the tolerances inside of smartphones has got to be a super difficult job so I won't fault
dataset/train/98_60.wav|them for the extra dab of glue. I am a fan of jerry-rigging after all.
dataset/train/98_61.wav|Back to the cute little wireless charger over the s pen slot. I can unstick that from the
dataset/train/98_62.wav|pen sheath and it's about what we would expect. A bunch of tiny copper coils making an electromagnetic
dataset/train/98_63.wav|field that the tiny coils on the s pen tip can use to charge up the tiny capacitor at
dataset/train/98_64.wav|the end of the pen. The motherboard is tucked up into the top of the phone frame. I can
dataset/train/98_65.wav|just pull it down and out. And here's where things start to get a little weird. Remember
dataset/train/98_66.wav|how this phone costs $1300? There is no thermal paste or copper inside to keep the processor
dataset/train/98_67.wav|cool. Nothing here on the gray stuff inside of the phone or on the back of the motherboard
dataset/train/98_68.wav|which is super unfortunate, especially because this is an international phone and the exynos
dataset/train/98_69.wav|processor is notorious for overheating and throttling. It's hard to believe that there
dataset/train/98_70.wav|is no copper in here for the heat dissipation. I can peel up the gray pad underneath the
dataset/train/98_71.wav|motherboard. Slicing it open looks like just a bunch of thick flaky graphite that we've
dataset/train/98_72.wav|seen as secondary thermal layers in other phones. But it's used as the primary thermal
dataset/train/98_73.wav|conductor here without thermal paste. If this was a $400 phone I'd be just fine, but this
dataset/train/98_74.wav|phone is the insane $1300. The thing that makes all of this even worse is that, like
dataset/train/98_75.wav|I said earlier, my phone is the international version. There is another teardown on YouTube
dataset/train/98_76.wav|done by iCase. I'll link his channel in the cards and description, but the phone he took
dataset/train/98_77.wav|apart has the US charger in the box which means it's probably using the Qualcomm chipset
dataset/train/98_78.wav|and clearly has a superior copper heat pipe cooling system inside.
dataset/train/98_79.wav|I don't quite understand how Samsung could get away with selling the same phone in different
dataset/train/98_80.wav|areas while having different components inside. Maybe there's more though. Let's go a bit
dataset/train/98_81.wav|deeper.
dataset/train/98_82.wav|Three more screws down at the bottom, two of which hold in the charging port, then the
dataset/train/98_83.wav|USB-C can come out of the phone. It does have a red rubber ring around the tip to help keep
dataset/train/98_84.wav|water out. And of course the bottom board with its microphone. The board rests on top
dataset/train/98_85.wav|of the small haptic vibration motor. And there's the water damage indicator sticker up by the
dataset/train/98_86.wav|top SIM card tray.
dataset/train/98_87.wav|Getting the battery out is always a nightmare just like the rest of the Samsung phones.
dataset/train/98_88.wav|I know they're probably still scared of batteries since the good old Note 7 days, but I'm pretty
dataset/train/98_89.wav|sure the battery isn't going to try to sneak out of the phone to scare anybody. Luckily
dataset/train/98_90.wav|I'm prepared with extra pry tools, and with enough gentle persistence I can get the battery
dataset/train/98_91.wav|out from inside of the phone. It's a 4500 milliamp hour capacity. It looks like now
dataset/train/98_92.wav|with everything gone that there might be some copper on the back side of the frame between
dataset/train/98_93.wav|the metal and the screen behind where the camera sensors sit as well as down here by
dataset/train/98_94.wav|the battery compartment, which would be fairly redeeming if there was a large vapor chamber
dataset/train/98_95.wav|back there. I think the only option we have at this point is to rip the screen off so
dataset/train/98_96.wav|we can see it. We have to find the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner anyway so we might as
dataset/train/98_97.wav|well. I'll just check the camera units before we obliterate the phone though.
dataset/train/98_98.wav|The Note 20 Ultra has three cameras this time around, all resting in their own metal frame.
dataset/train/98_99.wav|The 12 megapixel ultra wide camera up top, and the 108 megapixel main camera in the center.
dataset/train/98_100.wav|And the 12 megapixel 5 times optical zoom periscope camera down at the bottom. The main
dataset/train/98_101.wav|camera and the telephoto camera both have OIS. Just the OIS is internal with the telephoto.
dataset/train/98_102.wav|I show what that looks like and how it works with my teardown video of the S20 Ultra.
dataset/train/98_103.wav|Removing the screen kills the screen, so there's not really a need to be super gentle here.
dataset/train/98_104.wav|I'm just trying to avoid shattering the glass. The victus glass is shatter-resistant so we
dataset/train/98_105.wav|shouldn't have any problems. It's the display underneath the glass that usually dies. This
dataset/train/98_106.wav|display is different from the ROG phone we took apart last week. The display is made
dataset/train/98_107.wav|of a flexible material like we saw inside of the Galaxy Fold and it doesn't crack or
dataset/train/98_108.wav|shatter. It turns out that the copper we saw was just a large sticker for the screen. There's
dataset/train/98_109.wav|no vapor chamber to be found anywhere. It does have the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner
dataset/train/98_110.wav|down at the bottom but I guess we could have seen that from inside the phone too. It was
dataset/train/98_111.wav|still worth taking the screen off.
dataset/train/98_112.wav|Now I don't claim to be a thermal expert, but I do know the very hot history of the
dataset/train/98_113.wav|exynos processors, and I guess I'm just disturbed on multiple levels here. One, I don't think
dataset/train/98_114.wav|this cooling is adequate for their hot processor. And two, why in the world does a $1300 phone
dataset/train/98_115.wav|not have a copper vapor chamber inside? It's $1300. And more importantly, why are there
dataset/train/98_116.wav|Galaxy Note Ultras being sold with different components inside the phones? It's kind of
dataset/train/98_117.wav|sketchy. Ifixit and I both had graphite heat pads in our Note 20 Ultra 5Gs, and it could
dataset/train/98_118.wav|be that the copper vapor chamber is included on the ITE version. I'd have to take apart
dataset/train/98_119.wav|some more phones to be sure, but still, there probably is a performance difference and it's
dataset/train/98_120.wav|rather confusing to have a phone with the same name and different internals. I'm not
dataset/train/98_121.wav|a huge fan of where Samsung sells a phone with the same name and basically the same
dataset/train/98_122.wav|price if it has different parts and acts differently. Samsung should be putting a different name
dataset/train/98_123.wav|on it.
dataset/train/98_124.wav|If you remember, Samsung also removed those 5G millimeter wave antennas from the international
dataset/train/98_125.wav|version of the S20 Ultra. I know I personally currently use the Note 10 Plus, but I'm thinking
dataset/train/98_126.wav|my next phone won't be a Samsung. Samsung has changed a lot during the past few years.
dataset/train/98_127.wav|Anyway, let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. Do you think smartphone
dataset/train/98_128.wav|manufacturers should be allowed to change the internal design of their phone and sell
dataset/train/98_129.wav|it with the same name, or do you think that's kind of sketchy? I'm curious. Hit that subscribe
dataset/train/98_130.wav|button if you haven't already. And come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter. Thanks
dataset/train/98_131.wav|a ton for watching. I'll see you around.
